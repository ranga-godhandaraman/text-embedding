https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n• \\nThis boundary has been determined under the Radcliffe Award which divided the erstwhile province of \\nBengal into two parts. \\nIndia-Myanmar Boundary \\n• \\nThis boundary runs roughly along the watershed between the Brahmaputra and Irrawaddy rivers.  \\n• \\nIt passes through thickly forested regions, with Mizo Hills, Manipur and Nagaland on the Indian side and \\nChin Hills, Naga Hills and Kachin state on the Myanmar side.    \\nIndia-Sri Lanka Boundary \\n• \\nIndia and Sri Lanka are separated from each other by a narrow and shallow sea called Palk Strait.  \\n• \\nDhanushkodi on the Tamil Nadu coast in India is only 32 km away from Talaimanar in Jaffna peninsula in \\nSri Lanka. These two points are joined by a group of islets forming Rama Setu (Adam\\'s Bridge).  \\n1.3 Major Physical Divisions of India \\n1. The Himalayas (young fold mountains),  \\n2.

Precipitation in the western Himalayas is comparatively low and oc-\\ncurs mostly as snowfall whereas in the eastern Himalayas the precipitation is greater and occurs mostly in \\nthe form of rain.  \\n• \\nIn the Great Himalayan ranges, the snow line is at a lower elevation on the southern slopes than on the \\nnorthern slopes because the southern slopes receive more precipitation as compared to the northern \\nslopes. \\n3.10 Glaciers in the Himalayas \\n• \\nThere are about 15,000 glaciers in the Himalayas.  \\n• \\nThe total area of Himalayas is about five lakh square kilometres (area of India is nearly 32 lakh square km). \\nAbout 33,000 square km area is covered by snow. \\nGlaciers of the Karakoram Range \\n• \\nMaximum development of glaciers occurs in the Karakoram range.  \\n• \\nSome of the largest glaciers outside the polar and sub-polar regions are found in this range.  \\n• \\nThe southern side of this range has many gigantic glaciers. \\n• \\nThe 75 km long Siachen Glacier in Nubra valley has the distinction of being the largest glacier outside \\nthe polar and the sub-polar regions.  \\n• \\nThe second largest is the 74 km long Fedchenko Glacier (Pamirs). \\n• \\nThird largest is the Hispar Glacier. It is 62 km long and occupies a tributary of the Hunza River.  \\nGlaciers of the Pir Panjal Range \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n33 \\n \\n• \\nThe glaciers of the Pir Panjal Range are less numerous and smaller in size as compared to those of the Ka-\\nrakoram Range.  \\n• \\nThe longest Sonapani Glacier in the Chandra Valley of Lahul and Spiti region is only 15 km long.  \\nOthers \\n• \\nGlaciers of the Kumaon-Garhwal Region: In the Kumaon-Garhwal region of the Himalayas, the largest is the \\n30 km long Gangotri Glacier which is the source of the river Ganga.  \\nGarhwal Region  \\n• \\nLying in the Himalayas, it is bounded on the north by Tibet, on the east by Kumaon region, on \\nthe south by Uttar Pradesh state, and on the northwest by Himachal Pradesh state.  \\n• \\nIt includes the districts of Chamoli, Dehradun, Haridwar, Pauri Garhwal, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal, \\nand Uttarkashi. \\n \\nGarhwal Region \\n• \\nGlaciers of Central Nepal: Zemu and the Kanchenjunga glaciers are the major ones.  \\n3.11 The significance of the Himalayas \\nInfluence on Indian Climate \\n• \\nThey intercept the summer monsoons coming from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea causing pre-\\ncipitation in the entire Ganga Plains, North-Eastern Hills.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n34 \\n \\n• \\nThey direct the monsoon winds towards north-western India (Punjab, Haryana etc. But these regions re-\\nceive most of the rainfall due to Western Disturbances coming from the Mediterranean regions).  \\n• \\nThey protect northern-plains from the cold continental air masses of central Asia.  \\n• \\nThe Himalayas influence the path of Sub-tropical Jet stream flowing in the region. They split the jet stream, \\nand this split jet stream plays an important role in bringing monsoons to India. \\n• \\nHad there been no Himalayas, the whole of India would have been a desert and its winters would have \\nbeen very severe. \\nSource of Rivers \\n• \\nRivers that feed nearly half a billion population of India originate in the Himalayas.  \\n• \\nAll the rivers are perennial supplying water year round. \\nFertile Soil \\n• \\nThe swift flowing rivers from the Himalayas bring an enormous amount of silt (alluvium) which continually \\nenrich the Ganga and Brahmaputra plains. \\nHydroelectricity \\n• \\nDue to its natural topography and swift flowing perennial rivers, the Himalayan region offers several natural \\nsites with great hydroelectric power generation potential.  \\n• \\nMany hydroelectric power plants have already been constructed. \\n• \\nBut all this comes at a tremendous environmental cost. \\nForest Wealth \\n• \\nThe Himalayan host rich coniferous and evergreen forests.  \\n• \\nLower levels have tropical evergreen forests, and higher levels have Alpine vegetation (Coniferous).  \\n• \\nThe Himalayan forests provide fuelwood and a large variety of timber for industries.  \\n• \\nHimalayan forests host a wide variety of medicinal plants.  \\n• \\nSeveral patches are covered with grass offering rich pastures for grazing animals. \\nAgriculture \\n• \\nDue to rugged and sloped terrain, the Himalayas are not potential agricultural sites. \\n• \\nSome slopes are terraced for cultivation. Rice is the main crop on the terraced slopes.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n35 \\n \\n• \\nThe other crops are wheat, maize, potatoes, etc.  \\n• \\nTea is a unique crop which can be grown only on the Shiwalik hill slopes in the region.  \\n• \\nFruit cultivation is a principal occupation. A wide variety of fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, mulberry, \\nwalnut, cherries, peaches, apricot, etc. are also grown in the Himalayan region. \\nTourism \\n• \\nHimalayan ranges have a large number of tourist spots.  \\n• \\nThe hilly areas in the Himalayas are not affected by hot winds like the loo. Hence, they offer cool and com-\\nfortable climate.  \\n• \\nThe increasing popularity of winter sports has increased the rush of tourists in winters.  \\n• \\nSrinagar, Dalhousie, Dharamshala, Chamba, Shimla, Kulu, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, Ranikhet, Al-\\nmora, Darjeeling, Mirik, Gangtok, etc. are important tourist centres in the Himalayas. \\nCultural Tourism \\n• \\nHimalayas host many Hindu and Buddhist shrines.  \\n• \\nKailas, Amarnath, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Vaishnu Devi, Jwalaji, Uttarkashi, Gangotri, Yamunotri, etc. \\nare important places of pilgrimage. \\nDefense \\n• \\nThe Himalayas are a natural defense barrier.  \\n• \\nBut the Chinese aggression on India in 1962 has reduced the defence significance of the Himalayas. \\nMineral Resources in the Himalayas \\n• \\nGeosynclinal (geosynclinical) deposits in tertiary rocks are regions of potential coal (peat) and oil reserves. \\n• \\nCoal is found in Kashmir, Copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, limestone, semi-precious and precious stones oc-\\ncur at some places in the Himalayas.  \\n• \\nBut the exploitation of these resources requires advanced technologies which are not yet available. \\n3.12 Major Passes in Himalayas and Indian Sub-continent \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n36 \\n \\n \\n \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n37 \\n \\n \\n \\n• \\nSela Pass is between Bum La and Bom Di La.

Its width decreases in the east.  \\n• \\nThe thickness of the alluvium deposits also varies from place to place. The maximum depth of the alluvium \\nup to the basement rocks is about 6,100 m (not uniform and varies greatly from place to place).  \\n• \\nExtreme horizontality of this monotonous plain is its chief characteristic.  \\n• \\nIts average elevation is about 200 m above mean sea level, highest elevation being 291 m above mean sea \\nlevel near Ambala (This elevation forms the drainage divide or watershed between Indus system and \\nGanga system).  \\n• \\nIts average gradient from Saharanpur to Kolkata is only 20 cm per km and it decreases to 15 cm per km \\nfrom Varanasi to the Ganga delta. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n46 \\n \\nDivisions of Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain \\n• \\nGeologically, the alluvium of the Great plain of India is divided into newer or younger khadar and older \\nbhangar soils.  \\nThe Bhabar  \\n• \\nIt is a narrow, porous, northernmost stretch of Indo-Gangetic plain. \\n• \\nIt is about 8-16 km wide running in an east-west direction along the foothills (alluvial fans) of the Shiwa-\\nliks. \\n• \\nThey show a remarkable continuity from the Indus to the Tista.  \\n• \\nRivers descending from the Himalayas deposit their load along the foothills in the form of alluvial fans.  \\n• \\nThese alluvial fans (often pebbly soils) have merged together to build up the bhabar belt.  \\n• \\nThe porosity of bhabar is the most unique feature. \\n• \\nThe porosity is due to deposition of huge number of pebbles and rock debris across the alluvial fans. \\n• \\nThe streams disappear once they reach the bhabar region because of this porosity.  \\n• \\nTherefore, the area is marked by dry river courses except in the rainy season.  \\n• \\nThe Bhabar belt is comparatively narrow in the east and extensive in the west.  \\nThe area is not suitable for agriculture, and only big trees with large roots thrive in this belt. \\nThe Terai \\n• \\nTerai is an ill-drained, damp (marshy) and thickly forested narrow tract to the south of Bhabar running \\nparallel to it. \\n• \\nThe Terai is about15-30 km wide.  \\n• \\nThe underground streams of the Bhabar belt re-emerge in this belt.  \\nThis thickly forested region provides shelter to a variety of wildlife.

They are a source of common salt \\nand many other salts.  \\n• \\nSambhar, Didwana, Degana, Kuchaman, etc. are some of the important lakes. The largest is the Sambhar \\nlake near Jaipur. \\nPunjab Plain \\n• \\nThis plain is formed by five important rivers of the Indus system. \\n• \\nThe plain is primarily made up of ‘doabs’ — the land between two rivers.  \\n• \\nThe depositional process by the rivers has united these doabs giving a homogenous appearance. \\n• \\nPunjab literally means \"(The Land of) Five Waters\" referring to the following rivers: the Jhe-\\nlum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas.  \\n• \\nThe average elevation of the plain is about 250 m above mean sea level.  \\n• \\nThe eastern boundary of Punjab Haryana plain is marked by subsurface Delhi-Aravali ridge. \\n• \\nThe northern part of this plain (Shiwalik hills) has been intensively eroded by numerous streams called \\nChos.  This has led to enormous gullying.  \\n• \\nTo the south of the Satluj river, there is Malwa plain of Punjab.  \\n• \\nThe area between the Ghaggar and the Yamuna rivers lies in Haryana and often termed as ‘Haryana Tract’. \\nIt acts as water-divide between the Yamuna and the Satluj rivers.  \\nThe only river between the Yamuna and the Satluj is the Ghaggar which is considered to be the present \\nday successor of the legendary Saraswati River. \\nGanga Plain \\n• \\nThis is the largest unit of the Great Plain of India stretching from Delhi to Kolkata (about 3.75 lakh sq km).  \\n• \\nThe Ganga along with its large number of tributaries originating in the Himalayans have brought large \\nquantities of alluvium from the mountains and deposited it here to build this extensive plain.  \\n• \\nThe peninsular rivers such as Chambal, Betwa, Ken, Son, etc. joining the Ganga river system have also con-\\ntributed to the formation of this plain.  \\n• \\nRivers flow sluggishly in the lower sections of Ganges as a result of which the area is marked by local prom-\\ninences such as levees, bluffs, oxbow lakes, marshes, ravines, etc.  \\n• \\nAlmost all the rivers keep on shifting their courses making this area prone to frequent floods.  \\n• \\nThe Kosi river is very notorious in this respect. It has long been called the ‘Sorrow of Bihar’.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n50 \\n \\nRegional divisions of Ganga plains \\n• \\nRohilkhand plains  \\n• \\nAvadh Plains \\n• \\nMithila Plain \\n• \\nMagadh Plain. \\nGanga-Brahmaputra Delta  \\n• \\nThis is the largest delta in the world.  \\n• \\nThe slope of the land here is a mere 2 cm per km.

It is covered with dense forests \\nand is famous as the home of the Gir lion. \\nGujarat Plain  \\n• \\nThe Gujarat Plain lies east of Kachchh and Kathiawar and slopes towards the west and south-west.  \\n• \\nFormed by the rivers Narmada, Tapti, Mahi and Sabarmati, the plain includes the southern part of Gujarat \\nand the coastal areas of the Gulf of Khambhat.  \\n• \\nThe eastern part of this plain is fertile enough to support agriculture, but the greater part near the coast is \\ncovered by windblown loess (heaps of sand).  \\nKonkan Plain  \\n• \\nThe Konkan Plain south of the Gujarat plain extends from Daman to Goa (50 to 80 km wide).  \\n• \\nIt has some features of marine erosion including cliffs, shoals, reefs and islands in the Arabian Sea.  \\n• \\nThe Thane creek around Mumbai is an important embayment (a recess in a coastline forming a bay) which \\nprovides an excellent natural harbour.  \\nKarnataka Coastal Plain  \\n• \\nGoa to Mangalore.  \\n• \\nIt is a narrow plain with an average width of 30-50 km, the maximum being 70 km near Mangalore.  \\n• \\nAt some places, the streams originating in the Western Ghats descend along steep slopes and make water-\\nfalls.  \\n• \\nThe Sharavati while descending over such a steep slope makes an impressive waterfall known as Gersoppa \\n(Jog) Falls which is 271 m high. (Angel falls (979 m) in Venezuela is the highest waterfall on earth. Tugela \\nFalls (948 m) in Drakensberg mountains in South Africa is the second highest.) \\n• \\nMarine topography is quite marked on the coast. \\nKerala Plain  \\n• \\nThe Kerala Plain is also known as the Malabar Plain. \\n• \\nBetween Mangalore and Kanyakumari.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n67 \\n \\n• \\nThis is much wider than the Karnataka plain. It is a low lying plain.  \\n• \\nThe existence of lakes, lagoons, backwaters, spits, etc. is a significant characteristic of the Kerala coast.  \\n• \\nThe backwaters, locally known as kayals are the shallow lagoons or inlets of the sea, lying parallel to the \\ncoastline.  \\n• \\nThe largest among these is the Vembanad Lake which is about 75 km long and 5-10 km wide and gives \\nrise to a 55 km long spit (Marine Landforms).  \\n6.5 Eastern Coastal Plains of India \\n• \\nExtending from the Subarnarekha river along the West Bengal-Odisha border to Kanyakumari.  \\n• \\nA major part of the plains is formed as a result of the alluvial fillings of the littoral zone (relating to or on \\nthe shore of the sea or a lake) by the rivers Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery comprising some of \\nthe largest deltas.  \\n• \\nIn contrast to the West Coastal Plains, these are extensive plains with an average width of 120 km.  \\n• \\nThis plain is known as the Northern Circars between the Mahanadi and the Krishna rivers and Carnatic \\nbetween the Krishna and the Cauvery rivers.  \\nUtkal Plain \\n• \\nThe Utkal Plain comprises coastal areas of Odisha.  \\n• \\nIt includes the Mahanadi delta.  \\n• \\nThe most prominent physiographic feature of this plain is the Chilka Lake. \\n• \\nIt is the biggest lake and biggest brackish (salt) water (lagoon) lake in the country and its area varies \\nbetween 780 sq km in winter to 1,144 sq km in the monsoon months. Its length is around 64 km. \\n• \\nSouth of Chilka Lake, low hills dot the plain. \\n• \\nVembanad Lake (Kerala) is the longest lake in India with a length of 96 km. \\n• \\nWular Lake (Jammu and Kashmir), is the largest freshwater lake of India (260 sq km). \\n• \\nGobind Ballabh Pant Sagar (Rihand Dam) (UP), is the largest human-made lake of India by volume.  \\n• \\nShivaji Sagar Lake of Koyna Dam is the largest human-made lake of India by surface area. \\n• \\nRajasthan’s Sambhar Lake is the largest inland saltwater lake of India (200 sq km). \\n• \\nTso Lhamo Lake (Sikkim) is India’s highest lake (5,330 m) in India. \\nAndhra Plain  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n68 \\n \\n• \\nSouth of the Utkal Plain and extends up to Pulicat Lake. This lake has been barred by a long sand spit \\nknown as Sriharikota Island (ISRO launch facility).  \\n• \\nThe most significant feature of this plain is the delta formation by the rivers Godavari and Krishna.  \\n• \\nThe two deltas have merged and formed a single physiographic unit.  \\n• \\nThe combined delta has advanced by about 35 km towards the sea during recent years. This is clear from \\nthe present location of the Kolleru Lake which was once a lagoon at the shore but now lies far inland \\n(Coastline of Emergence).  \\n• \\nThis part of the plain has a straight coast and badly lacks good harbours with the exception of Vishakha-\\npatnam and Machilipatnam. \\nTamil Nadu Plain  \\n• \\nThe Tamil Nadu Plain stretches for 675 km from Pulicat lake to Kanyakumari along the coast of Tamil Nadu. \\nIts average width is 100 km.  \\n• \\nThe most important feature of this plain is the Cauvery delta where the plain is 130 km wide.  \\n• \\nThe fertile soil and large scale irrigation facilities have made the Cauvery delta the granary of South India. \\n6.6 The significance of the Coastal Plains \\n• \\nLarge parts of the coastal plains of India are covered by fertile soils on which different crops are grown. Rice \\nis the main crop of these areas.  \\n• \\nCoconut trees grow all along the coast.  \\n• \\nThe entire length of the coast is dotted with big and small ports which help in carrying out the trade.  \\n• \\nThe sedimentary rocks of these plains are said to contain large deposits of mineral oil (KG Basin).  \\n• \\nThe sands of Kerala coast have a large quantity of monazite which is used for nuclear power.  \\n• \\nFishing is an important occupation of the people living in coastal areas.  \\n• \\nLow lying areas of Gujarat are famous for producing salt. \\n• \\nKerala backwaters are important tourist destinations. \\n• \\nGoa provides good beaches. This is also an important tourist destination. \\n7. \\nIndian Islands \\n• \\nThe major island groups of India are Andaman and Nicobar Archipelago (a chain of islands similar in origin) \\nin Bay of Bengal and Lakshadweep islands in the Arabian Sea. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n69 \\n \\n• \\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands were formed due to the collision between Indian Plate and Burma Minor \\nPlate (part of Eurasian Plate) (Similar to the formation of Himalayas). \\n• \\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands are the southward extension of Arakan Yoma range (Myanmar) (Arakan \\nYoma in itself is an extension of Purvanchal Hills). \\n• \\nLakshadweep Islands are coral islands.

These rivers make deltas at their mouths.  \\n• \\nBut the west flowing rivers of Narmada and Tapti as well as those originating from the Western Ghats and \\nfalling in the Arabian Sea form estuaries in place of deltas. \\n• \\nThere are few places where rivers form superimposed and rejuvenated drainage which are represented by \\nwaterfalls.  \\n• \\nExamples: The Jog (289 m) on the Sharvati river, Yenna (183 m) of Mahabaleshwar, Sivasamundram \\n(101 m) on the Cauvery river, Gokak (55 m) on the Gokak river, Kapildhara (23 m) and Dhuandar (15 \\nm) on the Narmada river are the major waterfalls in the Peninsular India. \\nEvolution of the Peninsular Drainage \\nTheory 1 (most probable) \\n• \\nGeologists believe that the Sahyadri-Aravalli axis was the main water divide in the past.  \\n• \\nAccording to one hypothesis, the existing peninsula is the remaining half of the bigger landmass.  \\n• \\nThe Western Ghats were located in the middle of this landmass. \\n• \\nSo, one drainage was towards east flowing into the Bay of Bengal and the other towards west draining into \\nthe Arabian Sea.  \\n• \\nThe western part of the Peninsula cracked and submerged in the Arabian Sea during the early Tertiary pe-\\nriod (coinciding with the formation of Himalayas).  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n96 \\n \\n• \\nDuring the collision of the Indian plate, the Peninsular block was subjected to subsidence in few regions \\ncreating a series of rifts (trough, faults). \\n• \\nThe now west flowing rivers of the Peninsula, namely the Narmada and the Tapti flow through these \\nrifts.  \\n• \\nStraight coastline, steep western slope of the Western Ghats, and the absence of delta formations on \\nthe west coast make this theory a possibility.  \\nTheory 2 \\n• \\nIt is believed that the west flowing peninsular rivers do not flow in the valleys formed by the rivers them-\\nselves.  \\n• \\nRather they have occupied two fault rifts in rocks running parallel to the Vindhyas.  \\n• \\nThese faults are supposed to be caused by the bend of the northern part of the Peninsula at the time \\nof upheaval of the Himalayas.  \\n• \\nPeninsular block, south of the cracks, tilted slightly eastwards during the event thus giving the orientation \\nto the entire drainage towards the Bay of Bengal.  \\n• \\nCriticism: Tilting should have increased the gradient of the river valleys and caused some rejuvenation of \\nthe rivers. This type of phenomenon is absent in the Peninsula, barring a few exceptions such as waterfalls. \\nComparison: Himalayan River System & Peninsular River System \\nFeatures \\nThe Himalayan River System \\nThe Peninsular River System \\nOrigin \\n• \\nThese rivets originate from the lofty \\nHimalayan ranges and are named as \\nthe Himalayan rivers. \\n• \\nThese rivers originate in the hills of Penin-\\nsular Plateau and are named as Peninsular \\nrivers. \\nCatchment ar-\\nea \\n• \\nThese rivers have large basins and \\ncatchment areas.  \\n• \\nThe total basin area of the Indus, the \\nGanga and the Brahmaputra are 11.78, \\n8.61 and 5.8 lakh square kilometres re-\\nspectively. \\n• \\nThese rivers have comparatively small ba-\\nsins and catchment areas.  \\n• \\nThe Godavari has the largest basin area of \\n3.12 lakh square kilometres. \\nValleys  \\n• \\nThe Himalayan rivers flow through \\ndeep V-shaped valleys called gorges.  \\n• \\nThese gorges have been carved out by \\n• \\nThe Peninsular rivers flow in comparatively \\nshallow valleys.  \\n• \\nThese are more or less completely graded \\nWebsite -

Fishing is a dominant occupation around estuaries. Most \\nof the estuaries are good bird sanctuaries.  \\n• \\nAlthough influenced by the tides, they are protected from the full force of ocean waves, winds, and \\nstorms by such landforms as barrier islands or peninsulas. (estuaries make good ports. E.g. New York \\nHarbour is at the mouth of the Hudson River; Mormugao port in Goa at the mouth of the Zuari river \\nand Mondovi river) \\n• \\nEstuarine environments are among the most productive on earth, creating more organic matter each \\nyear than comparably-sized areas of forest, grassland, or agricultural land. \\n• \\nThe tidal, sheltered waters of estuaries also support unique communities of plants and animals. \\n• \\nEstuaries benefits for tourism and recreational activities. \\n• \\nWater draining from uplands carries sediments, nutrients, and other pollutants to estuaries.

Troughs occur where cold air mass \\ndrops into warm air.  \\n• \\nThe region on earth below the trough is at low pressure and the region below ridge is at high pres-\\nsure.  \\n• \\nThis condition occurs due to the weakening of jet stream due to lesser temperature contrast between sub-\\ntropics and temperate region (our concern is STJ only). \\n• \\nUsually, the trough region (the region exactly below the jet stream trough) creates a cyclonic condi-\\ntion (low pressure) at the surface of earth whereas the ridge regions creates an anticyclonic condition. \\n \\nJet Streak \\n• \\nThese ridges and troughs give rise to jet streaks which are also responsible for cyclonic and anticyclonic \\nweather conditions at the surface.   \\n• \\nThe winds leaving the jet streak are rapidly diverging, creating a lower pressure at the upper level (Tropo-\\npause) in the atmosphere.  \\n• \\nThe air below rapidly replaces the upper outflowing winds. This, in turn, creates the low pressure at the \\nsurface.  \\n• \\nThis surface low pressure creates conditions where the surrounding surface winds rush inwards.  \\n• \\nThe Coriolis effect creates the cyclonic rotation (cyclonic vortex) that is associated with depressions (low-\\npressure cells).  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n136 \\n \\n• \\nThe winds entering the jet streak are rapidly converging because of the high pressure at the upper level \\n(Tropopause) in the atmosphere.  \\n• \\nThis convergence at upper troposphere leads to divergence (high pressure) at the surface (anticyclonic \\ncondition).  \\n• \\nThe Coriolis effect creates the anticyclonic rotation that is associated with clear weather.  \\nBut how does this mechanism of jet streams influence Indian Monsoons?  \\nIndian Monsoon Mechanism – Role of Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ) \\n• \\nSub-Tropical Jet stream plays a significant role in both hindering the monsoon winds as well as in \\nquick onset of monsoons. \\nSTJ – Sub-Tropical Jet Stream \\n• \\nThe sub-tropical Jet stream is a narrow band of fast moving air flowing from west to east (Westerlies).  \\n• \\nSTJ in northern hemisphere flows between 25° to 35° N in the upper troposphere at the height of about 12-\\n14 km (the height of each portion of the jet stream varies when there is meandering. Their path is \\nsometimes influenced by the Greater Himalayas). \\n• \\nThe wind speeds in a westerly jet stream are commonly 150 to 300 kmph with extreme values reaching 400 \\nkmph.  \\nThe burst of monsoons depends upon the upper air circulation which is dominated by STJ. \\nSeasonal Migration of Sub-Tropical Jet Stream – STJ \\n• \\nIn winter STJ flows along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, but in summer it shifts northwards, rather \\ndramatically, and flows along the northern edge of Himalayas in early June and late summer (July-August) \\nalong the northern Tibetan Plateau. \\n• \\nThe periodic movement of the Jet stream is often the indicator of the onset (STJ shits to the north of Hima-\\nlayas in a matter of days) and subsequent withdrawal (STJ returns to its position – south of Himalayas) of \\nthe monsoon. \\n• \\nNorthward movement of the subtropical jet is the first indication of the onset of the monsoon over India. \\nSub-Tropical Jet Stream – STJ in Winter \\n• \\nWesterly jet stream blows at a very high speed during winter over the sub-tropical zone.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n137 \\n \\n• \\nThis jet stream is bifurcated by the Himalayan ranges (physical barrier) and Tibetan Plateau (thermal barri-\\ner).  \\n• \\nThe two branches reunite off the east coast of China.  \\n• \\nThe northern branch of this jet stream blows along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.  \\n• \\nThe southern branch blows to the south of the Himalayan ranges along 25° north latitude.  \\n• \\nA strong latitudinal thermal gradient (differences in temperature), along with other factors, is respon-\\nsible for the development of southerly jet. \\n• \\nThe southern branch is stronger, with an average speed of about 240 kmph compared with 70 to 90 kmph \\nof the northern branch.  \\n• \\nAir subsiding beneath this upper westerly current gives dry out blowing northerly winds from the \\nsubtropical anticyclone over north-western India and Pakistan.  \\nWestern Disturbances  \\n• \\nMeteorologists believe that the southern branch of jet stream exercises a significant influence on the win-\\nter weather conditions in India.  \\n• \\nThe southern branch of the jet stream is responsible for steering of the western depressions (Western \\nDisturbances) from the Mediterranean Sea. \\n• \\nThese depressions are residual frontal cyclones which move at the height of 2000 meters from the mean \\nsea level. On the way, they pick up moisture from the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea.  \\n• \\nOn an average, 4 to 6 cyclonic waves reach north-western India between October and April each year. \\n• \\nSome of the depressions continue eastwards, redeveloping in the zone of jet stream confluence about 30° \\nN, 105° E (near the east coast of China). \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n138 \\n \\n \\nPath of Western Disturbances \\nWeather associated with Western Disturbances \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n139 \\n \\n• \\nThe arrival of these temperate storms (remnants of temperate cyclones) (western disturbances) causes pre-\\ncipitation leading to an abrupt decrease in air temperature over North-West India.  \\n• \\nWinter rain and heat storms in north-western plains, occasional heavy snowfall in hilly regions and \\ncold waves in the whole of northern plains are caused by these disturbances.  \\nImportance of Western Disturbances \\n• \\nThe western disturbances affect weather conditions during the winter season up to Patna (Bihar) and give \\noccasional rainfall which is highly beneficial for the standing rabi crops (wheat, barley, mustard, gram, \\nlentil, etc.). \\nWhy there are no south-west monsoons during winter? \\n• \\nReason 1: ITCZ has left India (the winds that blow over India are mostly offshore –– land to land or land to \\nthe ocean –– so they carry no moisture). \\n• \\nReason 2: During winter, the southern branch of STJ is strong and is to the south of Himalayas. The ridge \\nof the jet lies over north-western India and is associated with strong divergence of winds and creates a \\nhigh-pressure region (sub-tropical high-pressure belt) over entire north India. (This is how the mechanism \\nof jet streams influence Indian Monsoons in winter season) \\n• \\nReason 3: There is already a strong high pressure over Tibet. (High Pressure due to STJ + High Pressure \\nover Tibet = strong divergence = no rainfall) \\nSub-Tropical Jet Stream – STJ in Summer \\n• \\nWith the beginning of summer in March, the STJ (upper westerlies) start their northward march.  \\n• \\nThe southerly branch of STJ remains positioned south of Tibet, although weakening in intensity.  \\n• \\nThe weather over northern India becomes hot, dry and squally due to larger incoming solar radiation and \\nhot winds like the loo.  \\n• \\nOver India, the Equatorial Trough (ITCZ) pushes northwards with the weakening of the STJ (upper wester-\\nlies) south of Tibet, but the burst of the monsoon does not take place until the upper-air circulation \\nhas switched to its summer pattern.  \\n• \\nBy the end of May, the southern jet breaks and later it is diverted to the north of Tibet Plateau, and \\nthere is a sudden burst of monsoons (the ridge moves northwards into Central Asia = high pressure \\nover north-west India moves northwards into Central Asia = makes way for south-west monsoon \\nwinds).  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n140 \\n \\n• \\nAn Easterly jet emerges over peninsular India with the northward migration of STJ. \\n• \\nThe upper air circulations are reversed with the emergence of Easterly jet (convergence in upper layers is \\nreplaced by divergence == divergence in lower layers is replaced with convergence == high pressure at \\nlower layers is replaced by low-pressure system).  \\n• \\nThe easterly winds become very active in the upper troposphere, and they are associated with westerly \\nwinds in the lower troposphere (south-west monsoon winds).  \\n• \\nWestern and eastern jets flow to the north and south of the Himalayas respectively. The eastern jet be-\\ncomes powerful and is stationed at 15° N latitude.  \\n• \\nThis results in more active south-west monsoon and heavy rainfall is caused.  \\nWhy no south-west monsoons in March-May (summer)? \\n• \\nThere is good sun’s insolation from March-May but still, there are no s-w monsoons. \\nReason: The ridge region of the Southern branch of STJ creates strong divergence (high pressure) in \\nnorth-west India. The diverging air blocks incoming winds and prevents strong convergence of winds \\nalong ITCZ.   \\n• \\nDuring the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere, low-pressure areas develop at the ground surface \\nnear Peshawar (Pakistan) and north-west India due to intense heating of ground surface during April, May, \\nand June.  \\n• \\nAs long as the position of the upper air jet stream is maintained above the surface low pressure (to the \\nsouth of Himalayas), the dynamic anti-cyclonic conditions persist over north-west India.  \\n• \\nThe winds descending from the upper air high pressure (because of the ridge of STJ) obstructs the \\nascent of winds from the surface low-pressure areas, with the result that the weather remains warm \\nand dry.  \\n• \\nThis is why the months of April and May are generally dry and rainless in spite of high temperatures (low \\npressure on land) and high evaporation. \\nCloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n141 \\n \\n \\nCloudburst \\n• \\nA cloudburst is an intense torrential rainfall brought by a thunderstorm that lasts for a relatively short du-\\nration (few minutes to few hours). \\n• \\nCloudburst leads to flash floods and causes a lot of damage to life and property. \\n• \\nEvery intense rainfall is not a Cloudburst.

The TEJ is found near between 5° and 20°N. \\n• \\nIt is fairly persistent in its direction, and intensity from June through the beginning of October.  \\n• \\nTEJ comes into existence quickly after the STJ has shifted to the north of the Himalayas (Early June). \\n• \\nTEJ flows from east to west over peninsular India at 6 – 9 km and over the Northern African region. \\n• \\nThe formation of TEJ results in the reversal of upper air circulation patterns (High-pressure switches to \\nlow pressure) and leads to the quick onset of monsoons. \\n• \\nRecent observations have revealed that the intensity and duration of heating of Tibetan Plateau has a direct \\nbearing on the amount of rainfall in India by the monsoons.  \\n• \\nWhen the summer temperature of air over Tibet remains high for a sufficiently long time, it helps in \\nstrengthening the easterly jet and results in heavy rainfall in India.  \\n• \\nThe easterly jet does not come into existence if the snow over the Tibet Plateau does not melt. This \\nhampers the occurrence of rainfall in India.  \\n• \\nTherefore, any year of thick and widespread snow over Tibet will be followed by a year of weak \\nmonsoon and less rainfall. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n144 \\n \\n \\nPermanent and Temporary Jet Streams \\nIndian Monsoons – Role of Tibet \\n• \\nThe Tibetan Plateau is an enormous block of highland acting as a formidable barrier.  \\n• \\nTibet gets heated in summer and is 2 to 3 °C warmer than the air over the adjoining regions.  \\n• \\nBecause the Tibet Plateau is a source of heat for the atmosphere, it generates an area of rising air (conver-\\ngence) (intense low-pressure cell).  \\n• \\nDuring its ascent, the air spreads outwards in the upper troposphere (divergence) and gradually sinks (sub-\\nsidence) over the equatorial part of the Indian Ocean (monsoon cell).  \\n• \\nIt finally approaches the west coast of India as a return current from a south-westerly direction and is \\ntermed as equatorial westerlies.  \\n• \\nIt picks up moisture from the Indian Ocean and causes rainfall in India and adjoining countries. \\n• \\nThe plateau also affects the atmosphere in two ways: (a) as a mechanical barrier and (b) as a high-level \\nheat source.  \\n• \\nAt the beginning of June, the subtropical jet stream is completely withdrawn from India and occupies a po-\\nsition along 40° N (to the north of Tibetan Plateau).  \\n• \\nThe plateau accentuates the northward displacement of the jet stream. Hence the burst of monsoon in \\nJune is prompted by the Himalayas and not by the thermally induced low-pressure cell over Tibet.  \\n(Tibetan plateau is responsible for south-west monsoons. But it is the STJ that facilitates sudden out-\\nburst of monsoons with its sudden northward migration) \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n145 \\n \\n• \\nIn the middle of October, the plateau proves to be the most important factor in causing the advance of the \\njet south of the Himalayas or bifurcating it into two parts. \\n• \\nIn winter Tibetan Plateau cools rapidly and produces a high-pressure cell.

Its \\ndirection is influenced by the monsoon winds. It reverses its direction with the monsoon winds. \\n• \\nFindlater Current in s-w monsoon season creates a zone of coastal upwelling near the horn of Africa \\n(good for fishing). \\n• \\nIt doesn’t have a significant impact on Indian Monsoons because the zone of upwelling is very small \\nunlike in the case of Indian Ocean Dipole.  \\n \\nSomali Current (Wikipedia) \\nIndian Monsoons – Role of Indian Ocean Dipole \\n• \\nIndian Ocean Dipole is a recently discovered phenomena that have a significant influence on Indian mon-\\nsoons. \\n• \\nIndian Ocean Dipole is an SST anomaly (Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly – different from normal) that \\noccurs occasionally in Northern or Equatorial Indian Ocean Region (IOR). \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n147 \\n \\n• \\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between two areas \\n(or poles, hence a dipole) – a western pole in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean) and an eastern \\npole in the eastern Indian Ocean south of Indonesia.  \\n• \\nIOD develops in the equatorial region of Indian Ocean from April to May peaking in October. \\n• \\nWith positive IOD winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west (from Bay of Bengal towards the \\nArabian Sea).  \\n• \\nThis results in the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African Coast) being much warmer and \\neastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry. \\n• \\nIn the negative dipole year, the reverse happens to make Indonesia much warmer and rainier.  \\n• \\nPositive IOD is good for Indian Monsoons as more evaporation occurs in warm water. \\n• \\nSimilar to ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD is named as Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation \\n(EQUINOO) (Oscillation of pressure cells between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea). \\n• \\nDuring the positive phase of the ‘Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO),’ there is enhanced cloud \\nformation and rainfall in western part of the equatorial ocean near the African coast while such activity is \\nsuppressed near Sumatra. \\n \\nIndian Ocean Dipole \\nProjects to understand monsoons \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n148 \\n \\nISMEX  \\n• \\nTwo more experiments were conducted, jointly, by India and the former USSR in 1973 and 1977, with lim-\\nited participation from other countries.  \\n• \\nThese experiments are known as the Indo-Soviet Monsoon Experiment (ISMEX) and Monsoon-77 respec-\\ntively.  \\nMONEX  \\n• \\nData collection effort was made under the aegis of MONEX-1979.  \\n• \\nIt was organised jointly by many researching organizations and the World Meteorological Organisation \\n(WMO) under their World Weather Watch (WWW) programme.  \\n• \\nIt is so far the largest scientific effort made to understand monsoons.  \\nDetails are not necessary.

They receive comparatively less so-\\nlar insolation.  \\n• \\nBut summer is equally hot in north India because of hot local wind called loo.  \\n• \\nWinter is very cold due to cold waves brought by the western disturbances. \\n• \\nSome places in Himalayas record low temperatures particularly in winter.  \\n• \\nCoastal regions see moderate climatic conditions irrespective of latitudinal position. \\nDistance from the Sea \\n• \\nCoastal regions have a moderate or equable or maritime climate whereas interior locations are deprived of \\nthe moderating influence of the sea and experience extreme or continental climate.  \\n• \\nThe monsoon winds first reach the coastal regions and hence bring a good amount of rainfall. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n151 \\n \\nHimalayas \\n• \\nThe Himalayas act as a climatic divide between India and Central Asia. \\n• \\nDuring winter, Himalayas protect India from cold and dry air masses of Central Asia.  \\n• \\nDuring monsoon months these mountain ranges act as an effective physical barrier for rain-bearing \\nsouth-west monsoon winds (Orographic Rainfall).  \\n• \\nThe Himalayas divide the Bay of Bengal branch of monsoon winds into two branches – one branch \\nflowing along the plain regions towards north-west India and the other towards South-East Asia.  \\n• \\nIf the Himalayas were not present, the monsoon winds would simply move into China, and most of north \\nIndia would have been a desert. \\nWhy rainfall decreases from east to west in plains region (Indus-Ganga Plains)? \\n• \\nAs the monsoon winds move from east to west, the moisture levels decrease due to successive rainfall at \\neach low-pressure regions.  \\n• \\nBy the time winds reach western parts of the plains (Delhi, Haryana etc.) all the moisture in the monsoon \\nwinds in exhausted.  \\nThen how come Haryana and Punjab not deserts like Rajasthan? \\n• \\nThey receive rainfall due to Western Disturbances in winter. (In summer the rainfall is very low.) \\nPhysiography \\n• \\nPhysiography is the most important factor that determines the mean annual rainfall received by a region. \\nWhy are some parts in peninsular India semi-arid? \\n• \\nPlaces on the windward side of an orographic barrier receive a great amount of rainfall whereas those \\non the leeward side remain arid to semi-arid due to rain-shadow effect.  \\n• \\nExample: The south-west monsoon winds from the Arabian sea strike almost perpendicular at the Western \\nGhats and cause copious rainfall in the Western Coastal plain and the western slopes of the Western Ghats.  \\n• \\nOn the contrary, vast areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu lie in \\nrain-shadow or leeward side of the Western Ghats and receive scanty rainfall.  \\nWhy no significant rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan?

It may be as high as 18°C in some parts. \\n• \\nThe temperatures along the west coast are comparatively lower than those prevailing on the east coast due \\nto the prevailing westerly winds.  \\n• \\nNorthern and central parts of India experience heat waves in this season.  \\n(A heat wave is an abnormally high temperature experienced by a region. A temperature increase of the order of \\n6° to 7 °C above normal is termed as \\'moderate\\' and 8 °C and more as \\'severe\\' heat wave)  \\n• \\nThe heat waves strike by the end of April, and their maximum occurrence is in May.  \\n• \\nMost of the heat waves develop over Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (location far away from the sea). From \\nhere they spread over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.  \\n• \\nThe strong northwesterly winds (caused due to strong divergence in north-west India) with a long land \\njourney over hot regions check the onward march of the sea breeze over the eastern coastal belt and create \\nheatwave conditions over Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.  \\n• \\nHeat waves are rare over the peninsula south of 13 °N latitude due to maritime conditions prevailing there. \\nThe pressure in Summer Season \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n162 \\n \\n• \\nThe atmospheric pressure is low all over the country due to high temperature.  \\n• \\nBut strong dynamically induced divergence over north-west India prevents the onset of south-west \\nmonsoons. \\nWinds in Summer Season \\n \\nPrevailing winds and Cyclones paths in April \\n• \\nThere is a marked change in the direction and speed of the winds from winter.  \\n• \\nThe winds are by and large light and variable.  \\nLoo \\n• \\nLoo winds originate over Iranian, Baloch and Thar deserts. \\n• \\nIn May and June, the high temperature in northwest India builds steep pressure gradient. \\n• \\nHot, dust-laden and strong wind known as loo blows.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n163 \\n \\n• \\nLoo normally starts blowing by 9.00 A.M., increases gradually and reaches maximum intensity in the after-\\nnoon.  \\n• \\nIt blows with an average speed of 30-40 km per hour and persists for days.  \\nAndhis  \\n• \\nThe strong dust storms resulting from the convective phenomena are locally known as andhis (blinding \\nstorms). They move like a solid wall of dust and sand.  \\n• \\nThe wind velocity often reaches 50-60 kmph, and the visibility is reduced to a few metres.  \\n• \\nSuch dust storms are common in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu region, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and \\nMadhya Pradesh.  \\n• \\nThey are short-lived. The squall and showers which follow these storms bring down the temperature sharply \\ntemporarily. \\nFrontal Thunderstorms in Summer Season \\n• \\nThe strong convectional movements related to the westerly jet stream lead to thunderstorms in the eastern \\nand north-eastern part of the country.  \\n• \\nThey normally originate over Chota Nagpur plateau and are carried eastwards by westerly winds.  \\n• \\nThe areas with the highest incidence of thunderstorms are Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, \\nManipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, West Bengal and the adjoining areas of Odisha and Jharkhand.  \\nNorwesters and Thunderstorms in Summer Season \\n• \\nIn West Bengal and the adjoining areas of Jharkhand, Odisha and Assam, the direction of squalls is mainly \\nfrom the northwest, and they are called norwesters.  \\n• \\nThey are often very violent with squall speeds of 60 to 80 km per hour.  \\n• \\nThe rainfall brought by the norwesters is known as the spring storm showers.  \\n• \\nHailstones sometimes accompany showers and occasionally attain the size of a golf ball.  \\n• \\nThey cause heavy damage to standing crops, livestock and even lead to loss of human lives.  \\n• \\nHowever, they are, sometimes, useful for tea, jute and rice cultivation. In Assam, these storms are known as \\nTea Showers and Barodoli Chheerha.  \\n• \\nThe period of maximum occurrence of these storms is the month of Vaisakh (mid-March to mid-April), and \\nhence, they are locally known as Kalabaisakhis, the black storms or a mass of dark clouds of Vaiasakha.  \\nConvectional Thunderstorms in Summer Season \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n164 \\n \\n• \\nIn the south, the thunderstorms occur in Kerala and adjoining parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, particu-\\nlarly during evenings and nights.  \\n• \\nIn Karnataka, they are called cherry blossoms or blossom showers due to their effect on the coffee plan-\\ntations.  \\n• \\nSuch showers are called mango showers in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh because they are very \\nbeneficial to mango crop.  \\nWestern Disturbances in Summer Season \\n• \\nTheir frequency and intensity gradually decrease with the advancement of summer.  \\n• \\nApproximately 4, 3 and 2 western disturbances visit north-west India in March, April and May respectively.  \\n• \\nThey cause snowfall in higher reaches of the Himalayas. \\nTropical Cyclones in Summer Season \\n• \\nTropical cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.  \\n• \\nA few cyclones are formed in the Bay of Bengal in the month of March, but they do not affect the mainland \\nof India.  \\n• \\nTheir frequency rises steeply in April, and the number of cyclones originating in May is more than double \\nthan those originating in April.  \\n• \\nAbout three-fourths of the tropical cyclones are born in the Bay of Bengal, and the rest originate in the \\nArabian Sea.  \\n• \\nMost of the depressions in April originate to the south of 10 °N while those originating in May are born to \\nthe north of this latitude.  \\n• \\nMost of the storms of this season initially move west or north-west, but later they recurve northeast and \\nstrike Bangladesh and the Arakan Coast of Myanmar.  \\n• \\nVery few hit the Indian coast while some dissipate over the sea itself.  \\n• \\nThe coastal areas of Bangladesh and Arakan Coast of Myanmar are liable to be hit by tropical storms in \\nMay. Many of them are quite severe and cause heavy damage to life and property.  \\n• \\nIn the Arabian Sea, major storms are formed in May between 7° and 12° N latitudes.  \\n• \\nMost of them move away from the Indian coast in a north-westerly direction and dissipate in the sea.  \\n• \\nFew originate close to the Indian coast.

This is due to the \\nlack of clouds and hot continental air masses.  \\n• \\nOther parts of Northwest India also have temperatures above 30 °C.  \\n• \\nThe temperatures are quite low over the Western Ghats due to heavy rainfall.  \\n• \\nThe coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and adjoining parts of Andhra Pradesh have temperatures above 30 °C as \\nthey receive little rainfall during this season. \\nPressure and Winds During South West Monsoon Season \\n• \\nLow-pressure conditions prevail over northwest India due to high temperature.  \\n• \\nITCZ (monsoon trough) lies along the Ganga plain.  \\n• \\nThere are frequent changes in its location depending upon the weather conditions.  \\n• \\nThe atmospheric pressure increases steadily southwards.  \\n• \\nOver the peninsular region, due to the pressure gradient between north and south, winds blow in a south-\\nwest to northeast direction from Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal.  \\n• \\nTheir direction undergoes a change in Indo-Gangetic plain where they move from east to west. \\nRainfall During South West Monsoon Season \\n• \\nThree-fourths of the total annual rainfall is received during this season.  \\n• \\nThe average rainfall over the plains of India in this season is about 87 per cent.  \\n• \\nNormal date of the arrival of the monsoon is 20th May in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  \\n• \\nThe advance of the monsoon is much faster in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n168 \\n \\n \\nPrecipitation in South West monsoon Season \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n169 \\n \\n \\n• \\nThe normal date of onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala, i.e. the first place of entry in the main-\\nland of India is 1st June.  \\n• \\nThe monsoons advance quickly accompanied with a lot of thunder, lightning and heavy downpour. This \\nsudden onset of rain is termed as monsoon burst.  \\n• \\nSometimes monsoons are delayed, or they come much earlier than normal.  \\n• \\nNormally the onset occurs between 29th May and 7th June.  \\nSouth West Monsoon – Arabian Sea branch and Bay of Bengal branch \\n• \\nMonsoon winds beyond south Kerala progress in the form of two branches viz. the Arabian Sea branch \\nand the Bay of Bengal branch.  \\n \\n \\nSouth West Monsoon – Arabian Sea branch and Bay of Bengal branch \\n• \\nThe Arabian Sea branch gradually advances northwards. It reaches Mumbai by 10th June.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n170 \\n \\n• \\nThe Bay of Bengal branch spreads rather rapidly over most of Assam. The normal date of its arrival at Kolka-\\nta is 7th June.  \\n• \\nOn reaching the foothills of the Himalayas, the Bay branch is deflected westward by the Himalayan bar-\\nrier, and it advances up the Gangetic plain.  \\n• \\nThe two branches merge with each other mostly around Delhi to form a single current.  \\n• \\nBoth the branches reach Delhi more or less at the same time.  \\n• \\nBy the end of June, the monsoon is usually established over most parts of the country.  \\n• \\nBy mid-July, the monsoon extends into Kashmir and the remaining parts of the country. \\n• \\nBy this time, it reaches Kashmir; it has shed most of its moisture.  \\n• \\nArabian Sea branch of the monsoon is much powerful than the Bay of Bengal branch for reasons:  \\n1. The Arabian Sea is larger than the Bay of Bengal, and  \\n2. the entire Arabian Sea current advances towards India, whereas only a part of the Bay of Bengal \\ncurrent, enters India, the remainder proceeding to Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia. \\nThe Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoons is divided into three distinct streams on arriving in the \\nmainland of India. \\n• \\nThe first stream strikes the west coast of India and gives extremely heavy rainfall of over 250 cm.  \\n• \\nIt strikes perpendicular to the Western Ghats causing plentiful Orographic Rainfall (400 to 500 cm annual \\nrainfall on the windward side). \\n• \\nRainfall is drastically reduced to about 30-50 cm on the leeward side of the crest.  \\n• \\nThere is a narrow belt of marked aridity on the immediate leeward side of the Western Ghats. But once it is \\npassed, the air starts rising again and the amount of rainfall increases further east. \\n• \\nThe second stream enters Narmada—Tapti troughs (narrow rift valley) and reaches central India.  \\n• \\nIt does not cause much rain near the coast due to the absence of major orographic obstacle across the rift.  \\n• \\nSome parts of central India receive rainfall from this stream (Ex: Nagpur). \\n• \\nThe third stream moves parallel to the Aravalli Range without causing much rainfall.  \\n• \\nConsequently, the whole of Rajasthan is a desert area.  \\n• \\nHowever, some orographic effect is occurring on the south-eastern edge of the Aravalli Range. \\nMount Abu gets about 170 cm rainfall while the surrounding plains have only 60 to 80 cm rainfall. \\nThe Bay of Bengal Branch of the southwest monsoon is divided into two distinct streams. \\n• \\nThe first stream crosses the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta and reaches Meghalaya.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n171 \\n \\n• \\nHere that the orographic effect results in intense rainfall.  \\n• \\nCherrapunji receives an annual rainfall of 1,102 cm, a major portion of which occurs from June to August.  \\n• \\nMawsynram (present champion) located at 1,329 m above sea level just 16 km to the west of Cherrapun-\\nji (X champion) records higher annual rainfall of 1,221 cm.  \\n• \\nBoth the stations are located on the southern slopes of the Khasi hills at the northern end of a deep valley \\nrunning from south to north.  \\n• \\nThe second stream of the Bay of Bengal branch moves along Himalayan foothills as they are deflected to \\nthe west by the Himalaya and brings widespread rainfall to Ganga plain.  \\n• \\nThe rainfall by this stream is characterized by a steady decline as we move from east to west up the plain. \\n(Previous Prelims Question) \\n• \\nThe Tamil Nadu coast remains relatively dry during the south-west monsoon period because of  \\n1. rain shadow effect of the Arabian Sea current and  \\n2. Bay of Bengal current which flows parallel to the coast. \\nBreak in the South West Monsoons \\n• \\nDuring July and August, there are certain periods when the monsoons become weak.  \\n• \\nRainfall practically ceases over the country outside the Himalayan belt and southeast peninsula.  \\n• \\nThis is known as a break in the monsoon.  \\n• \\nDuring the break period, heavy rainfall occurs over the sub-Himalayan regions and the southern slopes of \\nthe Himalayas.  \\n• \\nOn an average one or two breaks do occur during the rainy season.  \\n• \\n85 out of 100 years there is a break in the monsoons. \\nWhat causes monsoon break? \\n• \\nThe breaks are believed to be brought about by the northward shifting of the monsoon trough (minimum \\nlow-pressure cells in ITCZ) to the foothills of Himalayas. \\n• \\nThis leads to a sharp decrease in rainfall over most parts of the country but increases along the Hima-\\nlayas and parts of Northeast India and the Southern Peninsula.  \\n• \\nBreaks are likely to occur during the second week of August and last for a week.  \\n• \\nThe breaks can also occur due to tropical cyclones which originate in the Bay of Bengal. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n172 \\n \\nThe monsoon trough is a portion of the Intertropical Convergence Zone as depicted by a line on a weather map \\nshowing the locations of minimum sea level pressure, and as such, is a convergence zone between the wind pat-\\nterns of the southern and northern hemispheres. \\nDepressions in South West Monsoon Season \\n• \\nA major part of the South West Monsoon rainfall is generated by depressions (intense low pressure) origi-\\nnating in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Some depressions develop over land also.  \\n• \\nAbout 3-4 depressions are formed per month from June to September.  \\n• \\nAlmost all of them are sucked inward through the deltas of great rivers (depressions need moisture to be \\nalive), the Ganga, the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery and cause heavy rain in these \\nareas. \\n• \\nThe location of depressions strongly coincides with the latitudinal position of ITCZ. \\n• \\nMost of the depression originate to the west of 90⁰ E in the Bay of Bengal and move in the north-west di-\\nrection.  \\n• \\nIn the Arabian Sea in June-July, the depressions move either in the north-west or in the northerly direction \\nand may affect west Gujarat or Maharashtra.  \\n• \\nStorms during August and September are rare and are formed close to Maharashtra-Gujarat coast. \\n• \\nMost of the rainfall in central and northern parts of the country is caused by these depressions.  \\n• \\nThe absence of depressions or a change in their tracks result in deficit or no rain. \\nAdvance and Withdrawal of South West Monsoons \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n173 \\n \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n174 \\n \\n \\nAdvance and Withdrawal Dates of South West Monsoons \\nChief Characteristics of South West Monsoon Rainfall \\n• \\nA major part of monsoon rains is received between June and September. \\n• \\nMonsoonal rainfall is largely governed by relief and is orographic in its mode.  \\n• \\nThe amount of rainfall decreases with increasing distance from the sea.  \\n• \\nThe rainless interval during south-west monsoon season is known as breaks.  \\n• \\nThere are large scale spatial variations in the distribution of rainfall.  \\n• \\nMonsoons often fail to keep the date.

But about 25% of them later re-\\ncurve northeast and strike the Maharashtra or Gujarat coast. \\n• \\nIn north-west India, the western disturbances produce clouding and light rainfall in the otherwise fine \\nweather.  \\n• \\nThe precipitation is in the form of snow in higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and in \\nKumaon Hills. \\nPrecipitation during Retreating Monsoon Season \\n• \\nThe humidity and cloud cover are much reduced with the retreat of the south-west monsoons, and most \\nparts of the country remain without much rainfall.  \\n• \\nOctober-November is the main rainy season in Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of Andhra Pradesh to \\nthe south of the Krishna delta as well as a secondary rainy period for Kerala.  \\n• \\nThe retreating monsoons absorb moisture while passing over the Bay of Bengal and cause this rainfall.  \\nAnnual Rainfall (South West Monsoons + Retreating Monsoons) \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n177 \\n \\n \\nAverage Annual Rainfall (South West Monsoons + Retreating Monsoons) \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n178 \\n \\nIsohyet (the line joining places of equal rainfall) [Compare this with isotherm (temperature), isobar \\n(pressure)] \\nAreas of very high rainfall \\n• \\nAreas receiving an annual rainfall of 200 cm and above.  \\n• \\nThese include the western side of Western Ghats (Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Mumbai in the \\nnorth).  \\n• \\nThe average annual rainfall in this belt is 200-400 cm.  \\n• \\nAssam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, parts of Manipur, Tripura and north-\\neastern tip of West Bengal also receive 200 cm or more, with isolated pockets receiving over 400 cm.  \\nMeghalaya (the abode of clouds) is the wettest part of the country with Mawsynram and Cherrapunji \\ngetting 1,221 and 1,102 cm of annual rainfall respectively. \\nAreas of high rainfall \\n• \\n100-200 cm annual rainfall.  \\n• \\nEastern slopes of the Western Ghats, the major part of the northern plain, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra \\nPradesh and Tamil Nadu.  \\nAreas of low rainfall \\n• \\n50-100 cm annual rainfall.  \\n• \\nLarge parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, western Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, eastern Raja-\\nsthan, Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh. \\nAreas of very low rainfall \\n• \\nThese are desert and semi-desert areas receiving less than 50 cm of annual rainfall.  \\n• \\nThey include large areas of western Rajasthan, Kachchh and most of Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir. \\n2.4 Climatic Regions of India  \\n• \\nWhile classifying Indian climatic regions, most geographers have given more importance to rainfall than to \\ntemperature as variations in rainfall are much more marked than those of temperature.  \\nHere we will see two classifications – Stamp\\'s and Koppen’s.

But they are heavy as they hold more water than the sandy soils. \\n• \\nThe best topsoil for growing plants is loam.  \\n• \\nLoamy soil is a mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as silt.  \\n• \\nSilt occurs as a deposit in river beds. The size of the silt particles is between those of sand and clay.  \\n• \\nThe loamy soil also has humus in it. It has the right water holding capacity for the growth of plants. \\n• \\nClayey and loamy soils are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat, and gram. Such soils are \\ngood at retaining water.  \\n• \\nFor paddy, soils rich in clay and organic matter and having a good capacity to retain water are ideal.  \\n• \\nFor lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils, which drain water easily, are required.  \\n• \\nFor cotton, sandy loam or loam, which drain water easily and can hold plenty of air, are more suita-\\nble. \\n4.2 Soil Profile (Soil Horizon)  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n196 \\n \\n• \\nA vertical section through different layers of the soil is called the soil profile. \\n• \\nEach layer differs in feel (texture), colour, depth and chemical composition.  \\n• \\nThese layers are referred to as horizons. \\n• \\nA soil horizon is a layer generally parallel to the soil surface, whose physical characteristics differ from the \\nlayers above and beneath. \\n• \\nHorizons are defined in most cases by obvious physical features, chiefly colour and texture. \\n• \\nThe uppermost horizon is generally dark in colour as it is rich in humus and minerals.  \\n• \\nThe humus makes the soil fertile and provides nutrients to growing plants.  \\n• \\nThis layer is generally soft, porous and can retain more water. It is called the topsoil or the A-horizon. \\n• \\nThe next layer has a lesser amount of humus but more of minerals.  \\n• \\nThis layer is generally harder and more compact and is called the B-horizon or the middle layer. \\n• \\nThe third layer is the C-horizon, which is made up of small lumps of rocks with cracks. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n197 \\n \\n \\nSoil Profile (Soil Horizon) \\nO Horizon \\n• \\nLayers dominated by organic material.  \\n• \\nSome O layers consist of undecomposed or partially decomposed litter (such as leaves, needles, twigs, \\nmoss, and lichens). \\n• \\nThey may be on top of either mineral or organic soils.  \\nA Horizon or Surface soil \\n• \\nIt is part of the top soil. \\n• \\nIn this layer, organic matter is mixed with mineral matter.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n198 \\n \\n• \\nIt is the layer of mineral soil with the most organic matter accumulation and soil life.  \\n• \\nThis layer is depleted of (eluviated of) iron, clay, aluminium, organic compounds, and other soluble constit-\\nuents.  \\n• \\nWhen depletion is pronounced, a lighter coloured \"E\" subsurface soil horizon is apparent at the base of the \\n\"A\" horizon.  \\nE horizon \\n• \\n\"E\" stands for an eluviated layer. \\n• \\nIt is the horizon that has been significantly leached of clay, iron, and aluminium oxides, which leaves a con-\\ncentration of resistant minerals, such as quartz, in the sand and silt sizes.  \\n• \\nThese are present only in older, well-developed soils, and generally, occur between the A and B horizons. \\nB Horizon or Subsoil \\n• \\nIt is a subsurface layer reflecting a chemical or physical alteration of parent material.  \\n• \\nThis layer accumulates all the leached minerals from A and E horizon. \\n• \\nThus iron, clay, aluminium and organic compounds accumulate in this horizon (illuviation (opposite of elu-\\nviation)). \\nC Horizon or Parent rock \\n• \\nWeathered parent material accumulates in this layer, i.e. the parent material in sedimentary deposits.  \\n• \\nIt is a layer of large unbroken rocks.  \\n• \\nThis layer may accumulate more soluble compounds (inorganic material). \\nR Horizon or Bedrock \\n• \\nThis layer denotes the layer of partially weathered bedrock at the base of the soil profile.  \\n• \\nUnlike the above layers, R horizons largely comprise continuous masses of hard rock.  \\n• \\nSoils formed in situ will exhibit strong similarities to this bedrock layer.  \\n• \\nThese areas of bedrock are under 50 feet of the other profiles. \\n4.3 Factors that influence soil formation in Indian Conditions \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n199 \\n \\n \\nParent Material \\n• \\nThe rocks from which soils are formed are called parent materials.  \\n• \\nIn most of the cases, the parent material determines the colouration, mineral composition and texture \\nof the soil.  \\n• \\nIn some cases, the soil formed may or may not have the same physical properties as the parent rock.  \\n• \\nClimatic factors induce chemical changes which also affect the physical properties of the soil. \\n• \\nThe surface rocks are exposed to the process of weathering. In this process, the rocks are converted into \\nfine grains and provide a base for the soil formation.  \\n• \\nIn Indian Conditions, parent material is generally categorized into: \\n1. Ancient crystalline and metamorphic rocks \\n2. Cuddapah and Vindhyan rocks \\n3. Gondwana rocks \\n4. Deccan basalts \\n5. Tertiary and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of extra peninsular India {Rock System} \\nAncient crystalline and metamorphic rocks \\n• \\nThey are the Oldest rocks (pre-Cambrian era) (formed due to solidification of molten magma about 4 bil-\\nlion years ago).  \\n• \\nThey form the ‘Basement Complex’ of peninsular India. \\n• \\nThey are basically granites, gneisses and schists.  \\n• \\nThese rocks are rich in ferromagnetic materials and give rise to red soils on weathering.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n200 \\n \\n• \\nThe red colour of these soils is due to the presence of iron oxide.  \\nCuddapah and Vindhyan rocks  \\n• \\nThey are ancient sedimentary rocks (4000 m thick). \\n• \\nOn weathering they give calcareous (containing calcium carbonate) and argillaceous (consisting of or con-\\ntaining clay) soils.  \\n• \\nThe soil is mostly devoid of metalliferous minerals. \\nGondwana rocks  \\n• \\nThese rocks are also sedimentary in nature, and they are much younger. \\n• \\nOn weathering, they give rise to comparatively less mature soils. \\n• \\nThe soil is more or less of uniform character but of low fertility.  \\nDeccan basalts \\n• \\nA volcanic outburst over a vast area of Peninsular India gave rise to Deccan Traps.  \\n• \\nBasaltic lava flowed out of fissures covering a vast area of about ten lakh sq km.  \\n• \\nBasalts are rich in titanium, magnetite, aluminium and magnesium.  \\n• \\nConsequently, the weathering of these rocks has given rise to soils of darker colour.  \\n• The soil is fertile with high moisture holding capacity and is popularly known as regur or black cotton \\nsoil.  \\nTertiary and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks  \\n• \\nRocks of extra peninsular (plains and Himalayas) India have given rise to soils with high porosity.  \\n• \\nThese soils are generally immature recent and sub recent rocks, result in alluvial soils on weathering. \\n• \\nAlluvial fertile soils consist of fine silts and clay. These soils have little relation with the original rocks.  \\n• \\nOn the other hand, the soils of the peninsular plateau are generally coarse-grained and are closely re-\\nlated to the parent rocks. The peninsular soils are generally less fertile. \\nRelief \\n• \\nThe relief is the most important factor for soil formation in places with steep slopes like the hilly regions, \\nedges of plateaus etc. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n201 \\n \\n• \\nSoil erosion on barren slopes is rampant, and it hinders soil formation. Example: Chambal ravines, higher \\nreaches of the Himalayas where there is minimal or no forest cover (most on the steep southern slopes) etc. \\n• \\nThe areas of low relief or gentle slope generally experience deposition and have deep soils. Example: Indo-\\nGangetic plain. \\n• \\nThe exceptions in the plateau are river basins where the soil layers are sufficiently deep. \\nClimate \\n• \\nTemperature and rainfall are the most important factors in soil formation.  \\n• \\nThey determine the effectiveness of weathering of the parent material, the quantity of water seeping \\nthrough the soil and the type of micro-organisms present therein.  \\n• \\nTwo different parent materials may develop the same soil in the same type of climate.  \\n• \\nSimilarly, the same parent material may produce two different types of soils in two different types of cli-\\nmates.  \\n• \\nThe crystalline granites produce laterite (reddish clayey soils) soil in relatively moist parts of the \\nmonsoonal region and non-laterite soil in drier areas.  \\n• \\nHot summer and low rainfall develop black soil as is found in some parts of Tamil Nadu irrespective \\nof the parent rock.  \\n• \\nIn Rajasthan, both granite and sandstone give birth to sandy soil under arid climate.  \\n• \\nIn arid and semi-arid regions, evaporation always exceeds precipitation. There is little vegetation, and the \\nsoils badly lack humus content. Hence the soils are invariably of light colour.  \\n• \\nIn Rajasthan and the adjoining arid and semi-arid regions, an excess of evaporation makes soils lime ac-\\ncumulating.  \\n• \\nHence the soil is pedocal in nature (It is a class of soil which forms in semiarid and arid regions. It is rich in \\ncalcium carbonate and has low soil organic matter).  \\n• \\nIn cold climates of the Himalayan region, the process of vegetation decay is very slow, and the soils are \\nacidic in nature.  \\nIn areas of heavy rainfall and high temperature, the soils are red or lateritic. Why? \\n• \\nTorrential rainfall during the rainy season washes the upper soil and leaches the materials into the deeper \\nhorizon.  \\n• \\nDuring the dry summer season, the evaporation exceeds precipitation, and through capillary action, iron \\nand aluminium oxides are transported to the surface making the soil red.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n202 \\n \\n• \\nIn areas of alternate wet and dry climate, the leached material which goes deep down in the horizon is \\nbrought up, and the blazing sun bakes the topsoil so hard that it resembles a brick.  \\n• \\nTherefore, this soil is called lateritic which means brick.  \\nNatural Vegetation \\n• \\nNatural vegetation reflects the combined effects of relief and climate.  \\n• \\nThe formation and development of soil is very much influenced by the growth of vegetation.  \\n• \\nThe decayed leaf material adds much-needed humus to soil thereby increasing its fertility.  \\n• \\nThe densely forested areas contain some of the best soils in India.  \\n• \\nThere is a close relationship between the vegetation types and soil types in India. \\n4.4 Major Soil Groups of India \\n• \\nGeologically, Indian soils can broadly be divided into soils of peninsular India and soils of extra-peninsular \\nIndia. \\n• \\nThe soils of Peninsular India are formed by the decomposition of rocks in situ, i.e. directly from the \\nunderlying rocks.  \\n• \\nSoils of Peninsular India are transported and re-deposited to a limited extent and are known as sedentary \\nsoils.  \\n• \\nThe soils of the Extra-Peninsula (Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plains) are formed due to the deposi-\\ntional work of rivers and wind. They are very deep. They are often referred to as transported or azonal \\nsoils. \\n• \\nMajor soil groups: \\n(1) Alluvial soils \\n(2) Black soils \\n(3) Red soils \\n(4) Laterite and Lateritic soils \\n(5) Forest and Mountain soils \\n(6) Arid and Desert soils \\n(7) Saline and Alkaline soils \\n(8) Peaty and Marshy soils \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n203 \\n \\n \\nMajor Soil Groups of India \\nAlluvial Soils \\n• \\nAlluvial soils are formed mainly due to silt deposited by Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra rivers (transport-\\ned or azonal soils).  \\n• \\nIn coastal regions, some alluvial deposits are formed due to wave action.  \\n• \\nRocks of the Himalayas form the parent material. \\n• \\nThey are the largest soil group covering about 15 lakh sq km or about 45.6 per cent of the total area. \\n• \\nThey support more than 40% of India’s population by providing the most productive agricultural lands.  \\nCharacteristics of Alluvial Soils \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n204 \\n \\n• \\nThey are immature and have weak profiles due to their recent origin.  \\n• \\nMost of the soil is loamy. Sandy and clayey soils are not uncommon.  \\n• \\nPebbly and gravelly soils are rare.  \\n• \\nKankar (calcareous concretions) beds are present in some regions along the river terraces.  \\n• \\nThe soil is porous because of its loamy (equal proportion of sand and clay) nature.  \\n• \\nPorosity and texture provide good drainage and other conditions favourable for agriculture.  \\n• \\nThese soils are constantly replenished by the recurrent floods. \\nChemical properties of Alluvial Soils \\n• \\nThe proportion of nitrogen is generally low. \\n• \\nThe proportion of potash, phosphoric acid (phosphate) and alkalis (lime) are adequate. \\n• \\nThe proportion of Iron oxide and lime vary within a wide range.  \\nDistribution of Alluvial Soils in India \\n• \\nThey occur all along the Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plains except in few places where the top layer is \\ncovered by desert sand.  \\n• \\nThey also occur in deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery, where they are called \\ndeltaic alluvium (coastal alluvium). \\n• \\nSome alluvial soils are found in the Narmada, Tapti valleys and Northern parts of Gujarat. \\nCrops in Alluvial Soils \\n• \\nThey are mostly flat and regular soils and are best suited for agriculture. \\n• \\nThey are best suited to irrigation and respond well to the canal and well/tube-well irrigation.  \\n• \\nThey yield splendid crops of rice, wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, jute, maize, oilseeds, etc.  \\nGeological Divisions of alluvial soils \\n• \\nGeologically, the alluvium of the Great plain of India is divided into newer or younger khadar and older \\nbhangar soils.  \\nBlack Soils \\n• \\nThe parent material for most of the black soil are the volcanic rocks that were formed in the Deccan Plateau \\n(Deccan and the Rajmahal trap).  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n205 \\n \\n• \\nIn Tamil Nadu, gneisses and schists form the parent material. The former are sufficiently deep while the lat-\\ner are generally shallow. \\n• \\nThese are the region of high temperature and low rainfall. It is, therefore, a soil group typical to the dry \\nand hot regions of the Peninsula.  \\nCharacteristics of Black Soils \\n• \\nA typical black soil is highly argillaceous (containing clay) with a large clay factor, 62 per cent or more.  \\n• \\nIn general, black soils of uplands are of low fertility while those in the valleys are very fertile. \\n• \\nThe black soil is highly retentive of moisture.  \\n• \\nIt swells greatly on accumulating moisture.  \\n• \\nIn the rainy season, the soil gets very sticky and hence ploughing, and other agricultural activities demand \\nmore effort.  \\n• \\nIn summer, the moisture evaporates the soil shrinks and is seamed with broad and deep cracks.  \\n• \\nThe lower layers can still retain moisture. The cracks permit oxygenation of the soil to sufficient depths.  \\nColour of Black Soils \\n• \\nThe black colour is due to the presence of a small proportion of titaniferous magnetite or iron and black \\nconstituents of the parent rock.  \\n• \\nIn Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, the black colour is derived from crystalline schists and basic \\ngneisses. \\n• \\nVarious tints of the black colour may be found in this group of soils. \\nChemical Composition of Black Soils \\n• \\n10 per cent of alumina,  \\n• \\n9-10 per cent of iron oxide, \\n• \\n6-8 per cent of lime and magnesium carbonates, \\n• \\npotash is variable (less than 0.5 per cent) and  \\n• \\nphosphates, nitrogen and humus are low.  \\nDistribution of Black Soils \\n• \\nSpread over 5.46 lakh sq km (16.6 per cent of the total area) across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, parts \\nof Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n206 \\n \\nCrops in Black Soils \\n• \\nThese soils are best suited for cotton crop. Hence these soils are called as regur and black cotton soils.  \\n• \\nOther major crops grown on the black soils include wheat, jowar, linseed, virginia tobacco, castor, sunflower \\nand millets.  \\n• \\nRice and sugarcane are equally important where irrigation facilities are available.  \\n• \\nLarge varieties of vegetables and fruits are also successfully grown on the black soils. \\n• \\nThis soil has been used for growing a variety of crops for centuries without adding fertilisers and manures, \\nwith little or no evidence of exhaustion. \\nRed Soils \\n• \\nRed soils along with its minor groups form one of the largest soil group of India.  \\n• \\nThe main parent rocks are crystalline and metamorphic rocks like acid granites, gneisses and quartzites.  \\nCharacteristics of Red Soils \\n• \\nThe texture of these soils can vary from sand to clay, the majority being loams.  \\n• \\nOn the uplands, the red soils are poor, gravelly, and porous. But in the lower areas, they are rich, deep dark \\nand fertile. \\nChemical Composition of Red Soils \\n• \\nThey are acidic mainly due to the nature of the parent rocks. The alkali content is fair. \\n• \\nThey are poor in lime, magnesia, phosphates, nitrogen and humus. \\n• \\nThey are fairly rich in potash and potassium.  \\nColour of Red Soils \\n• \\nThe red colour is due to the presence of iron oxide. \\n• \\nThe colour is more due to the wide diffusion rather than the high percentage of iron oxide content. \\nDistribution of Red Soils \\n• \\nThese soils mostly occur in the regions of low rainfall. \\n• \\nThey occupy about 3.5 lakh sq km (10.6 per cent) of the total area of the country.  \\n• \\nThese soils are spread on almost the whole of Tamil Nadu.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n207 \\n \\n• \\nOther regions with red soil include parts of Karnataka, south-east of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pra-\\ndesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Chota Nagpur plateau; parts of south Bihar, West Bengal, Ut-\\ntar Pradesh; Aravallis and the eastern half of Rajasthan (Mewar or Marwar Plateau), parts of North-Eastern \\nstates. \\nCrops in Red Soils \\n• \\nThe red soils are mostly loamy and hence cannot retain water like the black soils.  \\n• \\nThe red soils, with the proper use of fertilisers and irrigation techniques, give a good yield of cotton, wheat, \\nrice, pulses, millets, tobacco, oilseeds, potatoes and fruits. \\nLaterite – Lateritic Soils \\n• \\nLaterite soils are mostly the end products of weathering.  \\n• \\nThey are formed under conditions of high temperature and heavy rainfall with alternate wet and dry \\nperiods.  \\n• \\nHeavy rainfall promotes leaching (nutrients gets washed away by water) of soil whereby lime and silica \\nare leached away, and a soil rich in oxides of iron and aluminium compounds is left behind.  \\n• \\n‘Laterite’ means brick in Latin. They harden greatly on losing moisture. \\n• \\nLaterite soils are red in colour due to little clay and more gravel of red sand-stones. \\nThe chemical composition of Laterite – Lateritic Soils \\n• \\nLaterite soils are rich in bauxite or ferric oxides. \\n• \\nThey are very poor in lime, magnesia, potash and nitrogen.  \\n• \\nSometimes, the phosphate content may be high in the form of iron phosphate.  \\n• \\nIn wetter places, there may be higher content of humus. \\nDistribution of Laterite – Lateritic Soils \\n• \\nLaterite soils cover an area of 2.48 lakh sq km.  \\n• \\nThe continuous stretch of laterite soil is found on the summits of Western Ghats at 1000 to 1500 m above \\nmean sea level, Eastern Ghats, the Rajmahal Hills, Vindhyan, Satpuras and Malwa Plateau.  \\n• \\nThey are well developed in south Maharashtra, parts of Karnataka etc. and are widely scattered in other re-\\ngions. \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n208 \\n \\nCrops in Laterite – Lateritic Soils \\n• \\nLaterite soils lack fertility due to intensive leaching.  \\n• \\nWhen manured and irrigated, some laterites are suitable for growing plantation crops like tea, coffee, rub-\\nber, cinchona, coconut, arecanut, etc.  \\n• \\nIn some areas, these soils support grazing grounds and scrub forests. \\nThe economic value of Laterite – Lateritic Soils \\n• \\nLaterite and lateritic soils provide valuable building material.  \\n• \\nThese soils can be easily cut into cakes but hardens like iron when exposed to air.  \\n• \\nAs it is the end-product of weathering, it cannot be weathered much further and is durable. \\nForest – Mountain Soils \\n• \\nThese soils occupy about 2.85 lakh sq km or 8.67% of the total land area of India.  \\n• \\nThey are mainly heterogeneous soils found on the hill slopes covered by forests.  \\n• \\nThe formation of these soils is mainly governed by the characteristic deposition of organic matter derived \\nfrom forests and their character changes with parent rocks, ground-configuration and climate.  \\n• \\nConsequently, they differ greatly even if they occur in close proximity to one another.  \\nDistribution of Forest – Mountain Soils \\n• \\nIn the Himalayan region, such soils are mainly found in valleys, less steep and north facing slopes. The \\nsouth-facing slopes are very steep and exposed to denudation and hence do not support soil formation.  \\n• \\nForest soils occur in Western and Eastern Ghats also. \\nChemical properties of Forest – Mountain Soils \\n• \\nThe forest soils are very rich in humus. \\n• \\nThey are deficient in potash, phosphorus and lime.  \\n• \\nThey require a good deal of fertilisers for high yields.  \\nCrops in Forest – Mountain Soils \\n• \\nThey are suitable for plantations of tea, coffee, spices and tropical fruits in the peninsular forest region. \\n• \\nWheat, maize, barley and temperate fruits are grown in the Himalayan forest region.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n209 \\n \\nArid – Desert Soils \\n• \\nThe desert soils consist of aeolian sand (90 to 95 per cent) and clay (5 to 10 per cent).  \\n• \\nThey cover a total area of 1.42 lakh sq km (4.32%).  \\n• \\nThe presence of sand inhibits soil growth. \\n• \\n Desertification of neighbouring soils is common due to the intrusion of aeolian sand (wind action). \\nDistribution of Arid – Desert Soils \\n• \\nOccur in arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.  \\n• \\nThe sand here is blown from the Indus basin and the coast by the prevailing south-west monsoon winds.  \\n• \\nSandy soils without clay factor are also common in coastal regions of Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  \\nChemical properties of Arid – Desert Soils \\n• \\nThey are usually poor in organic matter.  \\n• \\nSome desert soils are alkaline with varying degree of soluble salts like calcium carbonate.  \\n• \\nCalcium content increases downwards, and the subsoil has ten times more calcium.  \\n• \\nThe phosphate content of these soils is as high as in normal alluvial soils.  \\n• \\nNitrogen is originally low, but some of it is available in the form of nitrates.  \\nCrops of Arid – Desert Soils \\n• \\nPhosphates and nitrates make these soils fertile wherever moisture is available.  \\n• \\nThere is a possibility of reclaiming these soils if proper irrigation facilities are available.  \\n• \\nIn large areas, only the drought resistant and salt tolerant crops such as barley, cotton, millets, maize and \\npulses are grown.  \\nSaline – Alkaline Soils \\n• \\nIn Saline and Alkaline Soils, the topsoil is impregnated (soak or saturate with a substance) with saline and \\nalkaline efflorescences (become covered with salt particles).  \\n• \\nUndecomposed rock fragments, on weathering, give rise to sodium, magnesium and calcium salts and \\nsulphurous acid.   \\n• \\nSome of the salts are transported in solution by the rivers.  \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n210 \\n \\n• \\nIn regions with the low water table, the salts percolate into subsoil and in regions with good drainage, \\nthe salts are wasted away by flowing water. \\n• \\nBut in places where the drainage system is poor, the water with high salt concentration becomes stagnant \\nand deposits all the salts in the topsoil once the water evaporates.   \\n• \\nIn regions with the high sub-soil water table, injurious salts are transferred from below by the capillary \\naction as a result of evaporation in the dry season.  \\nCapillary action   \\n• \\nCapillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in op-\\nposition to, external forces like gravity. \\n• \\nThe force behind capillary action is surface tension. \\nSurface tension   \\n• \\nSurface tension is the elastic tendency of liquids (a membrane-like surface) that makes them acquire the \\nleast surface area possible.  \\n• \\nSurface tension causes insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on the wa-\\nter surface. \\n \\n• \\nSurface tension offers the necessary buoyant force (buoyancy) required for an object to float in water (Ships \\nfloat because of difference in density as well as surface tension).  \\n \\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nWebsite - https://upscpdf.com\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\nhttps://t.me/UPSC_PDF\\n \\n \\n211 \\n \\nWhat gives water droplet its shape? \\n• \\nWhen a water droplet is freely falling, it acquires a spherical shape. \\n• \\nWhen a water drop is on a surface, it acquires the shape of a hemisphere (half a sphere). \\n• \\nAll this is due to surface tension. \\n \\nThis kind of trivial GK can help with many exams. \\nDistribution of Saline – Alkaline Soils \\n• \\nSaline and Alkaline Soils occupy 68,000 sq km of area.  \\n• \\nThese soils are found in canal irrigated areas and areas of a high sub-soil water table.  \\n• \\nParts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab (side effects of im-\\nproper or excess irrigation), Rajasthan and Maharashtra have this kind of soils. \\n• \\nThe accumulation of these salts makes the soil infertile and renders it unfit for agriculture.  \\n• \\nIn Gujarat, the areas around the Gulf of Khambhat are affected by the sea tides carrying salt-laden depos-\\nits.

              "'HISTORY\\n1\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nUNDERSTANDING INDIAN HISTORY\\n1\\nNotes\\nHistory is the study of past events. It helps us to understand those processes that\\nenabled the early humans to successfully conquer their environment and develop the\\npresent day civilizations. It is not just a study of battles and kings as is normally\\nunderstood by some. It is an analysis of society, economy and cultural trends over a\\nlong period as reflected in  available sources. A historian tries to evaluate different\\nsituations over a long period and asks questions as to why certain events happened\\nand what was their impact on society at large? Every new evidence or a fresh inter-\\npretation of existing evidence by different scholars helps in enriching our knowledge\\nabout the past. A historian differentiates between fact and fiction. However , myths\\nwhich are based on oral tradition of a society may contain memories of past happen-\\nings. The historian’s job is to ascertain the fact through cross checking of different\\nhistorical evidence. In this lesson you will learn how India’s ancient past was con-\\nstructed with the help of large varieties of historical evidence and their interpretation.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nunderstand historical construction of India’s ancient past;\\n \\nknow about various types of source material used by ancient historians and\\n \\nidentify changing traditions of history writing.\\n1.1 SOURCES FOR RECONSTRUCTING ANCIENT INDIAN HISTORY\\nA historian needs source material to reconstruct the past. But sources themselves do\\nnot reveal the past. They need interpretation and the historian makes them speak. In\\nfact the historian is expected to track the source, read texts, follow clues, ask relevant\\nquestions, cross check evidence to offer meaningful explanation. For example in 1826\\nCharles Masson noticed the high walls and towers of an old settlement in Harappa\\nVillage of western Punjab ( now in Pakistan), and five decides later Sir Alexander\\nCunningham collected some seals from the site, but it took archaeologist John Marshall\\nanother fifty years to identify the oldest civilization in the Indus region. We shall offer\\nanother example regarding the historian’s task to cross check (corroborate) different\\ntypes of evidence. Nowhere in the sources pertaining to king Harsha (seventh cen-\\ntury AD) do we find a mention of his defeat at the hands of Chalukya ruler Pulakesin\\nII. But the inscriptions of Pulakesin II claim a victory over Harsha. In this case it is\\n2\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Indian History\\nobvious that Harsha’s biographer Bana Bhatt who wrote Harshacharita deliberately\\ndid not mention the defeat of his patron.\\nThe literal meaning of the itihasa is ‘thus it was’ and it is translated as ‘history’. There\\nwas a time when only written records were acknowledged as authentic source of\\nhistory. Written material could be verified, cited and cross-checked. Oral evidence i.e\\nmyths and folk songs was never considered a valid source. Earlier historians used\\nmyth, fiction and oral traditions in a limited way on account of their lack of authentic-\\nity and verifiability. But today these unconventional sources are being used innovatively.\\nTraditions and cultural traits should be studied in the light of other historical facts.\\nFor example the Mahabharata is a story of conflict between two sets of warring\\ncousins. One in not sure whether there was a real war as narrated in the epic. Some\\nhistorians believe that the war did happen while others wait for corroborative evi-\\ndence for the event .The original story was probably composed by bards known as\\nsutas who generally accompanied Kshatriya warriors to the battlefield and recited\\npoems in praise of victories and other achievements of their heroes. These composi-\\ntions were circulated orally and preserved as part of human memory.\\nLITERARY SOURCES\\n1.2 RELIGIOUS LITERATURE\\nMost ancient Indian texts contain religious themes and these are known as Vedas.\\nThey are assigned to c. 1500–500 B.C. The Vedas are four in number. The Rig Veda\\nmainly consists of prayers. The other three, Sama, Yajur and Atharva-contain prayers,\\nrituals, magic and mythological stories. The Upanishads contain philosophical discus-\\nsion on atma and pramatma. They are also referred to as Vedanta.\\nThe two epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, seem to have been finally compiled by\\nc.A.D. 400. Of the two, the Mahabharata is attributed to sage Vyasa. It originally\\nconsisted of 8800 verses and was called Jaya gita or a song dealing with victory.\\nThese later got expanded to 24,000 verses and came to be known as Bharata be-\\ncause it contained the stories of the descendents of one of the earliest Vedic tribes\\ncalled Bharata. A further expanded version of 1,00,000 verses was named\\nMahabharata. Similarly the Ramayana of Valmiki originally consisted of 6000 verses\\nthan 12,000 verses and was finally expanded to 24,000 verses.\\nIn the post-Vedic period ( i.e. after BC600) we have recorded a large number of ritual\\nliterature on moral values called Sutras. Grand public sacrifices to be performed by\\nrulers are recorded in Shrautasutra while domestic rituals connected with birth, naming,\\nsacred thread ceremony, marriage, funerals etc. are prescribed in Grihyasutras.\\nThis literature was compiled between c. 600–300 B.C.\\nThe religious books of the Jainas and Buddhists refer to historical persons and incidents\\nconnected with their respective religions. The earliest Buddhist texts were written in Pali.\\nThey are called Tripitakas (three baskets) viz. Suttapittaka, Vinayapitaka and\\nAbhidhammapitaka. Of the most important non religious Buddhist literature are the\\nJatakas. They contain the stories of the previous birth of the Buddha. It was believed that\\nbefore he was actually born as Gautama, the Buddha passed through over 550 births.\\nEach birth story is called a Jataka. These stories throw invaluable light on the social and\\neconomic conditions of the period between the fifth and second centuries BC The Jaina\\ntexts were written in Prakrit and were eventually compiled in sixth century AD at Vallabhi\\nin Gujarat. They are called Angas and contain the philosophical concepts of the Jainas.\\n3\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Indian History\\n1.3 SECULAR LITERATURE\\nThis category of literature does not have religion as its theme. To this class belongs\\nthe Dharmashastras or the law-books which prescribe the duties for different social\\ngroups. They set out punishments for persons guilty of theft , murder, adultery, etc.\\nThe earliest law books is Manu Smriti. It was the first book translated by the British\\nand formed the basis of Hindu code of law. Arthasastra of Kautilya provides rich\\nmaterial for the study of Indian economy and polity of the Mauryan period. Works on\\ngrammar are also sometimes useful for historical reconstruction. The earliest and the\\nmost important work on grammar is the Ashtadhyayi written by Panini, which is\\ndated by scholars to around 700 B.C.\\nThe works of Kalidasa who lived during the Gupta period comprise poems and\\ndramas. The famous among them are Abhijananashakuntalam, Ritusamhara\\nand Meghadutam. Besides being great creative compositions, they provide us\\nwith glimpses of the social and cultural life of the Guptas. For the history of\\nKashmir we have an important book called Rajataranagini written by Kalhana(\\n12th AD) Biographies or charitias are very important non-religious texts for writ-\\ning history. They were written by court poets in praise of their patron rulers. As\\nthere is a tendency among them to exaggerate the achievements of the patrons\\nthey have to be studied with caution. One such important text is Harshacharita,\\nwritten by Banabhatta in praise of Harshavardhana.\\nThe earliest south Indian literature is called Sangam literature. It was written in Tamil\\nand is secular in nature. It was produced by poets who joined together in assemblies\\n(Sangam) patronized by chiefs and kings during the first four centuries of the Chris-\\ntian era. The literature consists of short and long poems in praise of various heroes,\\nwritten probably to be recited in the courts. It also constitutes the epics called\\nSilpadikaram and Manimekali. The Sangam literature is our major source for the\\nstudy of south Indian society, economy and polity during BC300–AD300. The de-\\nscriptions given in the Sangam literatures are confirmed by archaeological finds and\\naccounts of foreign travellers.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.1\\n1.\\nGive the names of four Vedas?\\n(i)\\n (ii)\\n (iii)\\n (iv) \\n2.\\nWhich is the earliest text on Sanskrit Grammar?\\n3.\\nWhat are Jatakas?\\n4.\\nWhat is the language of the south Indian literature called Sangam Literature?\\n5.\\nWhat are the Upanishads?\\n4\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Indian History\\n1.4 NON-LITERARY SOURCES\\nINSCRIPTIONS\\nInscriptions are permanent writings engraved on hard surface such as stone, metal or\\nterracotta. Study of inscriptions is called epigraphy. The earliest inscriptions were written\\non stone. They usually record the achievements, activities and ideas of those who got\\nthem inscribed. So we get inscriptions which glorify the exploits of kings or mention\\ndonations made by men and women for religious purposes. Those inscriptions which are\\ncomposed by poets in praise of kings and patrons are known as prashastis. Some\\ninscriptions carry dates. Others are dated on the basis of palaeography or style of writing,\\nwith a fair amount of precision. The earliest inscriptions were in Prakrit, a name for a\\nlanguage used by ordinary people. In later times, Tamil and Sanskrit were also used to\\nwrite inscriptions.\\nThe Mauryan king Ashoka was the first person to issue inscriptions. Most of his\\ninscriptions are in Prakrit language written in the Brahmi script though, some in the\\nnorthwest, were written in Kharosthi. The Aramaic and Greek scripts were used for\\ninscriptions in Afghanistan so that the local people could understand their subject\\nmatter. The Brahmi script was first deciphered in 1837 by James Princep who was a\\ncivil servant during the British rule. Brahmi was written from left to right like Hindi\\nwhile Kharosthi from right to left. Ashokan inscriptions help us greatly in understand-\\ning his religious and administrative policies. From the first century B.C. the kings\\nstarted granting land to religious people. The Satavahans kings of the Deccan were\\nthe first ones to do so. These inscriptions record the concessions granted to the donee\\n( the receiver of grant ). Such inscriptions help us in finding out the religious and\\neconomic activities of the period. Some of these inscriptions are written on stone but\\nmost on copper plates. The copper plate charters were probably given as a record of\\nthe transaction to those who received the land and were granted concessions.\\nHowever, there are some limitations of inscriptional evidence. For example some-\\ntimes, letters are very faintly engraved, and thus reconstructions are uncertain. Also,\\ninscriptions may be damaged or letters missing. Besides, it is not always easy to be\\nsure about the exact meaning of the words used in inscriptions, some of which may be\\nspecific to a particular place or time.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.2\\n1.\\nWhat is the study of inscriptions called?\\n2.\\nWhat are parashatis?\\n3.\\nDefine palaeography?\\n4.\\nIn which script are most of the inscriptions of Ashoka written?\\n5\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Indian History\\n1.5 COINS\\nThe study of coins is known as numismatics. It not only includes visual elements such as\\nscript and images on the coins but also metallurgical analysis. Ancient coins were mostly\\nminted in metals such as copper, silver, gold and lead. The earliest coins found in India\\ncontained certain symbols and were called punch-marked coins. They were made of silver\\nand copper (c. sixth century BC onwards). The first coins to bear the names and images of\\nrulers were issued by the Indo-Greeks, who established control over the northwestern part\\nof the subcontinent (c. second century BC). The first gold coins were issued by the Kushanas\\nin c. first century AD. Some of the most spectacular gold coins were issued by the Gupta\\nrulers. Their earliest issues are remarkable for their purity of gold content.\\nCoins provide useful information regarding economic history as they were used as a\\nmedium of exchange. Some coins were issued by guilds or associations of the merchants\\nand craftsmen with the permission of the rulers. This shows the influence of craft and\\ncommerce. Coins also portray kings and gods, and contain religious symbols, all to which\\nthrow light on the art and religion of the time.\\nINTEXT QUESTON 1.3\\n1.\\nWhat is the study of the coins known as?\\n2.\\nName the metals used to make punch-marked coins?\\n3.\\nWhich dynasty issued the first gold coins in India?\\n1.6 ARCHAEOLOGY\\nThe material remains of the past can be studied with the help of archaeology. Archaeol-\\nogy is a science that enables us to systematically dig the successive layers of old mounds\\nand to form an idea of the material life of the people of the past on the basis of remains\\nfound there. Archaeology is very important to study prehistory i.e. the period before the\\ninvention of writing.  History is basically based on written material. Although writing was\\nknown in India by 2500 BC in the Indus culture, its script has not so far been deciphered.\\nThus, though the Harappans knew how to write but the historians have not been able to\\nread it. Their culture is placed in the period called proto-historic phase. The first script to\\nbe deciphered was Brahmi which was used in the Ashokan inscriptions and it belongs to\\nthe third century BC.\\nExcavations have brought to light the tools of early humans in India going as back as seven\\nlakh years.  The excavated sites belonging to the Harappan period show the layout of the\\nsettlements and the form of the houses in which people lived, the type of pottery, tools and\\nimplements they used and the kind of cereals they consumed . In south India some people\\nwere buried along with their tools, weapons, pottery and other belongings under big and\\nheavy stones. These graves are known as megaliths. By digging them we learn about the\\nlife of people who lived in the Deccan and south India before the third century BC.\\n6\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Indian History\\nThe dates of remains found in excavations are fixed by various methods. The most\\nimportant of them is the Radiocarbon or Carbon 14 (C14) dating method. Carbon 14\\nis a radioactive carbon present in all living objects. It decays, like all radioactive sub-\\nstances, at a uniform rate when the object is dead. By measuring the loss of C14\\ncontent in an ancient object (wood or bone) its age can be determined.\\nThe history of climate and vegetation is known through an examination of plant resi-\\ndues, and especially through pollen analysis. On this basis it is suggested that agricul-\\nture was practised in Kashmir and Rajasthan around 7000–6000 BC. The nature and\\ncomponents of metal artefacts can also be analysed scientifically, and consequently\\nthe mines from which metals were obtained are located and stages in the develop-\\nment of metal technology identified. The geological studies provide an idea of the\\nhistory of soil, rocks etc, where prehistoric man lived. Human history cannot be un-\\nderstood without an idea of the continuing interaction between soils, plants and ani-\\nmal, on one hand, and humans, on the other. Taken together with archaeological\\nremains, geological and biological studies act as important sources for the recon-\\nstruction and development of human history.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.4\\n1.\\nDefine Archaeology?\\n2.\\nWhat is the use of C14 dating?\\n1.7 ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN TRAVELLERS\\nIndigenous literature can be supplemented by foreign accounts. To India came Greek,\\nRoman and Chinese visitors, either as ambassadors or travellers or to seek religious\\nknowledge from time to time. They have left behind an account of the things they\\nsaw. To the court of Chandragupta Maurya came a Greek Ambassador called\\nMegasthenes who wrote Indika. Its original text is lost but parts of it have been\\npreserved in fragments quoted by subsequent Greek writers. When read together,\\nthese fragments, furnish valuable information not only about the administration but\\nalso social classes and economic activities of the Mauryan period.\\nGreek and Roman accounts of the first and second centuries mention many Indian\\nports and commodities of trade between India and the Roman Empire. The Periplus\\nof the Erythrean Sea and Ptolemy’s Geography, both written in Greek, provide\\nvaluable data in this regard.\\nOf the Chinese travelers, mention may be made of Fa-hsien and Hsuan Tsang.\\nBoth of them were Buddhist and came to this country mainly to visit the Buddhist\\nshrines and to study Buddhism. Fa-hsien who came to India in the fifth country AD\\ndescribes the conditions in India in the age of Guptas whereas Hsuan Tsang pre-\\nsents a similar account of India in the seventh century during the time of king\\nHarshavardhan. Hsuan Tsang also describes in detail the glory of Nalanda Univer-\\nsity (Bihar) during his times.\\n7\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Indian History\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.5\\n1.\\nWho wrote the Indika?\\n2.\\nName the Chinese travelers who came to India?\\n3.\\nWhich Chinese traveller refers to the glory of Nalanda University?\\n1.8 CHANGING NOTIONS OF HISTORY\\nIt was suggested, particularly by western scholars that ancient Indians had no\\nsense of writing history, But it is not true. Actually, Indian’s sense of writing\\nhistory was different from that of the Westerners. The people from the West\\nrecorded events in chronological order while the ancient Indians wrote in a dif-\\nferent manner. It can be seen in the texts called the Puranas where four differ-\\nent ages called Krita, Treita, Dvapara and Kali are mentioned. And in each age\\nwe get detailed lists of the rulers and dynasties. Besides, a large number of\\ninscriptions have been discovered. These give genealogies of kings of various\\ndynasties and also refer to their achievements. It shows that Indians had the\\nbasic knowledge of time (period) and space where events were taking place.\\nModern research in ancient India history began in 1765 when East India Com-\\npany took control of Bengal and Bihar. In order to administer the Hindu law,\\nManu Smriti the ancient Indian text on law was translated into English in 1776.\\nThese initial efforts of the British to understand ancient laws and customs culmi-\\nnated in the establishment of Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784. Under its aegis\\nand that of several other such societies Hindu religious and classical texts were\\ntranslated into English. The greatest impetus to Indological studies was given by\\nMax Mueller, a German born scholar. Soon the British realized that they needed\\nan intense knowledge of Indian scriptures and social systems to rule them better.\\nEven the Christian missionaries felt the need to know more about Indian laws\\nand customs in order to convert them and help the British strengthen their rule.\\nWhile translating the texts, western scholars wrote about Indian unwillingness to\\nchange and they being accustomed to despotic rule.\\nIn 1904, Vincent A Smith wrote Early History of India. It was the first systematic\\nhistory of ancient India. In this book his approach to history was pro British and he\\ntried to justify the British rule in India. It served as good propaganda material for the\\nperpetuation of despotic British rule.\\nThe Indian scholars, especially those who had received Western education, were\\nupset about the way the British were presenting India history to their advantage.\\nuided by the Nationalist ideas some of them took upon themselves the task of rewrit-\\ning history to show to the world the true glory of Indian culture. Two notable nation-\\nalist historians were R.G. Bhandarker (1837–1925) and V.K. Rajwade (1869–1926)\\nwho reconstructed social and political history with the help of various sources. While\\ndoing so they also attacked some of the social evils like child marriage and caste\\n8\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Indian History\\nsystem and promoted widow remarriage. The contribution of P.V. Kane (1880–1972)\\nis remarkable. He wrote a monumental work entitled History of Dharmasastra. It\\nhighlights the chief elements of ancient Indian society.\\nThese Indian scholars carefully studied ancient Indian texts on polity to demon-\\nstrate that ancient Indians had a keen sense of administration. D.R Bhandarkar\\n(1875–1950), an epigraphist, published books on ancient Indian political institu-\\ntions. H.C. Raychaudhuri (1892–1957) reconstructed the history of ancient India\\nand while doing so criticized V.A. Smith at many points. A stronger element\\nappears in the writings of R.C. Majumdar (1888–1980) who edited a multi-vol-\\nume History and Culture of Indian People. Until 1960, Indian scholars inspired\\nby the idea of nationalism glorified the histories of their respective regions and of\\nIndia as such. The merit of exploding the myth of despotism goes to K.P. Jayaswal\\n(1881–1937). He wrote about the existence of Indian republics and self-govern-\\nment in ancient India.\\nAfter independence, a new trend in history writing took over. There was a shift to-\\nwards the writing of non-political history with greater emphasis on society and\\neconomy. The Wonder that was India was one such pioneering work written by A.L.\\nBasham (1914–1986). A further shift is evident in D.D. Kosambi’s (1907 – 1966)\\nbook An Introduction to the Study of Indian History. His treatment follows a socio-\\neconomic aspect of ancient Indian history. After him a large number of historians\\nfollowed the trend and focused on social, economic and cultural history. Their main\\nstress was on means of production and the social and economic relationship among\\ndifferent groups of people.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 1.6\\n1.\\nDescribe the trend that developed in history writing after independence.\\n1.9 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY\\nFor an overall knowledge of the past, students are to be made aware of various\\naspects of society, called THEMES. These themes enable us to learn about de-\\nvelopments in different spheres – social, economic, religious, political and cul-\\ntural. The developments in these spheres are so much interlinked that they often\\nbreak the boundaries between them, for example when the pastoral society of\\nthe early Vedic Age got transformed into settled agricultural society in the later\\nVedic Age, the political system changed as a consequence. The king who was\\nearlier known as Gopati (lord of cattle) in pastoral society became Bhupati (lord\\nof land) with the development of agricultural economy. And with that the wars\\nbegan to be fought for acquiring more land instead of cows. The kings gradually\\nbecame powerful and kingship hereditary. So, we notice that changes in different\\nspheres are related to each other an they often influence major developments. In\\nthis course material you will learn about the development in the fields of art,\\narchitecture, caste system, science and economy, technology and also about the\\nrise and growth of various religious sects and rituals\\n9\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Indian History\\nTERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nWrite a short note on secular literature of Ancient India\\n2.\\nWrite five sentences on coins as a source material for reconstructing history?\\n3.\\nHow does archaeology help us in understanding the past?\\nANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS\\n1.1\\n1.\\nRig, Sama, Yajur, Atharva\\n2.\\nAshtadhyay\\n3.\\nThey contain stories of the previous lives of Gautama the Buddha\\n4.\\nTamil\\n5.\\nUpanishads are the last part of the Vedas.

The history of the people is greatly conditioned by the geography\\nand environment of the region in which they live. The physical geography and envi-\\nronmental conditions of a region include climate, soil types, water resources and\\nother topographical features. These determine the settlement pattern, population\\nspread, food products, human behaviour and dietary habits of a region. The Indian\\nsubcontinent is gifted with different regions with their distinct geographical features\\nwhich have greatly affected the course of its history.\\nGeographically speaking the Indian subcontinent in ancient times included the\\npresent day India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Pakistan.

These pass\\nthrough the Gomal, Bolan and Khyber passes. The Greeks, Shakas, Kushanas, Hunas\\nand other foreign tribes reached India following these routes. Likewise, Buddhism\\nand other Indian elements were carried out to Afghanistan and Central Asia through\\nthese mountain passes.\\n2.2 THE RIVER PLAINS OF NORTH INDIA\\nThe Himalayas also provide India with three river systems dominated by the Indus,\\nthe Ganges and the Brahmaputra. These rivers made their respective regions fertile\\nand attracted both settlers and invaders.\\nThe Indus plains include the regions of Punjab and Sind. Irrigated by the tributaries of\\nthe river Indus, they form a vast fertile plain which have made the region the ‘bread-\\nbasket’ of the subcontinent. It is called so because this region is very important for\\nwheat cultivation. The strategic location and richness of the Punjab region has at-\\ntracted foreign invaders since ancient past. The Sind region includes the lower Indus\\nValley and the delta. It is the Indus plains which witnessed the development of an\\nurbanized culture called the Harappan culture for the first time in the subcontinent.\\n(see lesson 3)\\nThe Gangetic basin receives more rainfall and is more humid than the Indus region.\\nThe Gangetic plains is divided into three sub-regions: Upper, Middle and Lower. The\\nUpper plains of the river Ganges constitute the western and southern parts of Uttar\\nPradesh. This region has seen active cultural developments since the ancient period.\\nThis was inhabited by the Aryans in the Later Vedic period, during which they prac-\\ntised agriculture. The Middle Gangetic plains, which is more fertile and has more\\nrainfall, include eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It is the region where mahajanpadas\\n(territorial states) like Kosala, Kasi and Magadha were established in the 6th century\\nBC. The two main religions of India, Jainism and Buddhism, also took their birth here.\\nThe lower Gangetic plains constitute the Bengal region. Its northern part is irrigated by\\nthe Brahmputra. The high rainfall in this region created dense forest and marshy land\\nwhich made it difficult for the development of settlements in the beginning. But its\\ncoastal areas served as important channels of communication with other regions of the\\nsubcontinent and also with the South-east Asian countries. Tamralipti or Tamluk was an\\nimportant seaport of this region which played a significant role in commercial activities.\\nThe Eastern India normally refers to the coastal plains formed by the river Mahanadi\\nand other streams. The fertile coastal plains of this region helped in the development\\nof agriculture, society and culture. This came into contact with the Gangetic culture\\nfrom the time of the Nandas and the Mauryas (4th century BC). Around AD 1000\\nOrissa began to develop her distinct linguistic and cultural identity.\\nThe Western India refers to the regions of the modern states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.\\nIt is known for its black soil which is good for cotton cultivitation. The Thar desert of\\nRajasthan, surrounded by the semi-arid regions, was not as fertile as the Gangetic\\nplains. As a result, this region was not much favourable for cultivation. However, later\\nin the 8th century AD, with the growth of irrigation mechanism in the form of Persian\\n13\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\nwheel (rehat), many settlements emerged here. Rajasthan is also the home of the\\nRajput clans. In Gujarat the fertile plains of the rivers Sabarmati, Mahi, Narmada and\\nTapti brought prosperity. A very long coastal line too helped Gujarat to develop con-\\ntacts with other countries through its ports. The most important sea port of this region\\nhas been Brigukaccha or Bharuch (Broach).\\n2.3 THE PENINSULAR INDIA\\nPeninsular India includes the Deccan plateau and the coastal plains of South India\\n(Map 2.2). The plateau is situated to the south of the Vindhya mountains. It is divided\\ninto three major regions which largely correspond to the modern states of Maharashtra,\\nAndhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The northern Deccan plateau comprises of a part of\\nMaharashtra. A number of Chalcolithic sites inhabited by people using copper and\\nstone tools have been found in this region. Karnataka includes the southwestern\\nMap 2.2 Peninsular India\\n14\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\nDeccan. This region with the availability of water and other resources had been more\\nsuitable for human settlements than the northern part. The Raichur doab for its rice\\ncultivation has been known as the ‘rice-bowl’ of South India. It has been the bone of\\ncontention between different kingdoms. These regions were inhabited right from the\\nprehistoric times.\\nThe plateau region also has hilly terrains in the Western and Eastern Ghats. The\\nWestern Ghats rise sharply close to the western coast, tapering eastwards into the\\nplateau. They are cut by a series of passes at Junnar, Kanheri and Karle. These\\nserved as trade routes connecting the ports along the west coast. At the southern end\\nof the Western Ghats is the Palghat pass which linked the west coast to the Kaveri\\nvalley and played an important role in the Indo-Roman trade in ancient period. The\\nEastern Ghats merge more gradually into the plateau and the coastal plain.\\nThe coastal plains constitute the states of Tamil Nadu in east and Kerala on west. In\\nTamil Nadu the rivers are seasonal. As a result, the people of this region have de-\\npended more on the tank irrigation since the early times. However, Kaveri delta has\\nbeen the major region of human attraction. It provided opportunity for the cultivation\\nof rice and witnessed the flourishing of the Sangam culture in the early historical\\nperiod. The ports such as Arikamedu and Kaveripattinam gave impetus to the Indo-\\nRoman Trade in early centuries of Christian era.

Environment is taken as the surroundings or conditions in which various\\nspecies (men, animals and plants) exist and function. The environment mainly com-\\nprises of elements such as climate, landscape, rivers, species of plants and animals\\n(flora and fauna), etc. Now, let us see how environment has influenced the life of\\npeople and their history since ancient past.\\nA semi-arid region is advantageous to people for settlement purpose. For example,\\nthe Sind region having this type of climate in ancient period, resulted in the flourishing\\nHarappan civilization. It also helped the growth of urban settlements. Similarly, the\\nrise of Pataliputra and the importance of Magadha in Bihar can also be explained in\\nrelation to its physical features and environment. Pataliputra was surrounded by the\\nrivers namely the Ganges, Son and Gandak which provided natural defence as well as\\ninternal communication.  Moreover, the fertile Indo-Gangetic plains helped in the\\nmaintenance of a strong population base.\\nThe environmental conditions also determine the resource potential of a region. The\\nforested region can be a rich source of timber, whereas the coastal regions yield the\\nsea products. The hilly regions with rocks containing the mineral ores can lead to the\\ndevelopment of metallurgy. The extraction of metals and their use for tools and other\\npurposes may add to the standard of living. For example, Magadha was located in\\nproximity to the iron ore mines and sources of stone and timber in the region of\\nChhotanagpur plateau. This strengthened the position of Magadha.\\nThe subsistence pattern is also influenced by the environmental conditions. The re-\\ngions covered by the river plains have alluvial soil. The fertility of soil helps in surplus\\nproduction. The type of soil also determines the crop pattern. For example, black soil\\nis good for growing cotton. The surplus production results in exchange activities which\\ndevelop into trade on a larger scale.\\nAn area gifted with navigable rivers has well developed trade and communication\\nnetworks. Our ancient literature like the Jatakas and other texts, mention many riv-\\nerine routes in ancient India. Similarly, the coastal routes promote the long distance\\ntrade with different countries. The mountain passes are  also very important in this\\ncontext. For example, the Palghat pass linked the east and west coasts and thus\\nhelped in the growth of Indo-Roman trade in ancient times.\\nThus, we find that the physical features and environment help us to unfold the histori-\\ncal processes of a region. The diversity of Indian subcontinent presents an uneven\\npattern of historical developments. The areas which were rich became important\\nwhile those with less resources lagged behind. It is important to observe that the\\nsettlement pattern and mode of life depend on the local resource utilization which in\\nturn is dependent on the technological developments in that region.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 2.2\\n1.\\nName the rivers which provided a natural defence to Pataliputra (modern Patna).\\n2.\\nWhich region supplied iron ore and timber to Magadha?\\n16\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\n3.\\nWhich type of soil is good for growing cotton?

Therefore our knowledge of the cultures, which developed in this period, is\\nbased only on the materials found in the archaeological excavations. The earliest man\\nliving during this period made tools and implements of stone found in his surroundings.\\nThese tools helped him to hunt and gather food in order to satisfy his hunger. Since the\\nearliest tools used by humans were made of stones, this phase of human development\\nis known as the Stone Age. In this lesson we shall trace the evolution of prehistoric\\nman from a hunter and food-gatherer to a food producer. This change did not take\\nplace all of a sudden and took several hundred thousand years. On the basis of the\\ndifferent type of tools and techniques the stages of human development in prehistoric\\nperiod are described as the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age, the Mesolithic or Middle\\nStone Age, and the Neolithic or New Stone Age.\\n2.6  THE PALAEOLITHIC CULTURES\\nThe term Palaeolithic is derived from the Greek word ‘palaeo’, which means old and ‘lithic’\\nmeaning stone. Therefore, the term Palaeolithic age refers to the old stone age. The archae-\\nologists have dated this culture to the Pleistocene period about two million years ago. The\\nPleistocene period is the geological period of the age when the earth’s surface was covered\\nwith ice, and weather was so cold that human or plant life could not survive. But in the\\ntropical region, where ice melted, the earliest species of men could exist.\\nThe people lived near the hillocks and used only stone tools for hunting and their protec-\\ntion. However, the choice of raw material used for tool-making varied from region to\\nregion and depended upon its availability. The material used was quartzite available in\\nhilly areas of different regions, basalt found in Maharashtra region and limestone in\\nKarnataka region. On the basis of the nature of progress made in tool types and tech-\\nniques the Palaeolithic cultures have been divided into three phases. These are – (i)\\nLower or Early Palaeolithic, (ii) Middle Palaeolithic, (iii) Upper or Late Palaeolithic.\\nThese phases covered a long period ranging broadly from 5,00,000 to 10,000 B.C.\\n(a)\\nTools of the Palaeolithic Period\\nThe main tools of lower Palaeolithic phase were handaxes, cleavers and choppers.\\n(Fig 2.1) These are called chopping tools. These were rough and heavy and were\\nmade by chipping the sides of the stones. Gradually, sharper and less heavy tools\\ncame to be made.\\nThe flake tools or chipped pieces were the chief tools during the middle Palaeolithic\\nperiod. (Fig 2.2) The tools of the upper Palaeolithic period primarily consisted of\\nburins and scrapers. (Fig 2.3)\\nLet us now discuss in brief the chief features and uses of some of the tools mentioned\\nabove. In handaxes, the butt end is broader and the working edge is narrow. These\\n17\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\nwere used for cutting the trees or digging the roots. The cleavers had a bifaced edge.\\nThese were meant for splitting objects like the trunks of trees. The choppers were the\\nmassive core tools with a unifacial working edge, and were used for chopping pur-\\nposes. The burins were like flakes or blades. These were used for engraving on soft\\nstones, bones or rocks. The scrapers were also made of flakes. These tools served\\nthe purpose of obtaining barks of trees and skins of animals.\\nFig 2.1 Chopping Tools & Hand Axes of Lower Paleolithic Age\\nFig 2.2 Chopping Tools & Hand Axes of Lower Paleolithic Age\\n Fig 2.3 Chopping Tools & Hand Axes of Lower Paleolithic Age\\n18\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\n(b)\\nGeographical Distribution of the Palaeolithic Sites\\nThe geographical distribution of the Palaeolithic sites suggests that this culture was spread\\nthroughout the length and breadth of the Indian subcontinent. (Map 2.3) In the north,\\nKashmir Valley and the Sohan Valley in Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan) have yielded\\nPalaeolithic tools. In Rajasthan, Palaeolithic tools were found at the sites along the\\nriver Luni. In Western India, the Palaeolithic tools were also discovered from the sites of\\nthe rivers Sabarmati, Mahi and their tributaries in Gujarat. In Maharashtra, the most im-\\nportant sites are Nevasa on a tributary of Godavari and Patne in the Tapti river system. In\\nMadhya Pradesh, the rock shelters at Bhimbetka (near Bhopal) and Adamgarh in the\\ndistrict Hoshangabad have yielded tools from the Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic period.\\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the Belan Valley (the region broadly from Allahabad to Varanasi) is\\nthe most prominent site.

Palaeolithic tools have also been found at various\\nsites in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar. In Peninsular India, Palaeolithic tools have been\\nreported from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, an important site is\\nAttirampakkam in Chingleput region. The subsistence of the Palaeolithic cultures\\nwas based mainly on hunting animals and gathering fruits and roots. In other words,\\nthe people were primarily hunters and gatherers with no settled habitation.\\nOn the basis of above discussion, we can conclude that the Palaeolithic cultures of\\nthe prehistoric period were wide spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. The study\\nof the tools indicates a gradual progress in tool technology which must have led to\\nbetter availability of resources.\\n(b)\\nSubsistence Pattern\\nThe Palaeolithic people practised hunting and food-gathering for their subsistence.\\nThey made simple stone tools for hunting, cutting, digging and other purposes.

In Greek ‘meso’\\nmeans the middle and ‘lithic’ means stone. Hence, the Mesolithic stage of prehistory is\\nalso known as the Middle Stone Age. It was the transitional phase between the Palaeolithic\\nand the Neolithic Ages. On the basis of archaeological discoveries, the beginning of the\\nMesolithic Age in Indian subcontinent is dated to around 10,000 BC.\\nThis period witnessed the rise in temperature, as a result of which the climate became\\nwarm. These changes further resulted in melting of ice of the earlier period and brought\\nabout changes in flora and fauna. Though man was still in hunting-gathering stage, he\\nnow started fishing and some domestication of animals. The main tools they used are\\ncalled the microliths or small stone tools. The Rock paintings found at Bhimbetka (near\\nBhopal)  belonging to the period indicate the artistic taste of the people.\\n(a)\\nTools of the Mesolithic Period\\nThe microliths used during the mesolithic period were very small in size varying in\\nlengths from 1 to 8 centimeters and were largely made out of chipped or flaked pieces.\\n(Fig 2.4) Some of these tools have geometric forms such as triangles, lunates and tra-\\npezes. There tools could be tied or fixed in other objects to form an arrow or a spear.\\n20\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\n(b)\\nGeographical Distribution of the Mesolithic Sites\\nThe distribution of Mesolithic sites indicates that the Mesolithic cultures covered al-\\nmost the entire India from north to south and east to west.

In addi-\\ntion to this, fishing and fowling also became important. The faunal remains of cattle,\\nsheep, goat, buffalo, pig, rat, bison, hippo, dog, fox, lizard, tortoise and fish etc. have\\nbeen found from different Mesolithic sites.\\n Fig 2.4 Tools of the Mesolithic Age\\n21\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 2.4\\n1.\\nWhat name has been given to the tools of the Mesolithic Age?\\n2.\\nName a few tools made during the Mesolithic period?\\n3.\\nName any two sites of the Mesolithic period?\\n2.8 THE NEOLITHIC CULTURES AND THE ADVENT OF FOOD\\nPRODUCTION\\nThe last phase of prehistory is termed as Neolithic. The term Neolithic is derived\\nfrom Greek ‘neo’ which means new, and ‘lithic’ meaning stone. Thus, the term\\n‘neolithic Age’ refers to the ‘New Stone Age’ of human culture. In Indian subconti-\\nnent it is dated back to around 8000 BC. The term ‘Neolithic’ was coined by Jonn\\nLubbock. The chief characteristic of this age was the new type of ground and pol-\\nished stone tools. This period also marked the beginning of cultivation of plants and\\nthe domestication of animals. It led to the beginning of settled life and the growth of\\nvillage settlements. The Neolithic culture had following characteristics:\\n(i)\\nBeginning of agricultural activities\\n(ii) Domestication of animals\\n(iii) Grinding and polishing of stone tools having sharper edges\\n(iv) Use of pottery\\n(a)\\nMeaning of the ‘Neolithic Revolution’\\nSome times this period is termed as the ‘Neolithic Revolution’ on the basis of impor-\\ntant changes in man’s socio-economic life. The use of the sharp and polished neolithic\\ntools made it easier to cultivate the soil. It was accompanied by the practice of do-\\nmestication of animals. These changes in turn resulted in the emergence of settled\\nagricultural communities. The Neolithic people also produced pottery for the purpose\\nof storing grains. As the redevelopment in the Neolithic phase greatly affected the\\nhuman life, some scholars have used the term “the Neolithic Revolution” to signify\\nthose changes. But most of the scholars believe that these changes though significant,\\nshould be viewed in the context of earlier progress during Paleolithic and Mesolithic\\nages, and thus, should be considered as ‘evolution’ rather than ‘revolution’.\\n(b)\\nTools of the Neolithic Period\\nThe Neolithic tools consist of the ground tools having smooth surfaces, and well-\\nrounded and symmetrical shapes. The grinding made the tools sharper, polished and\\nmore effective than those in the earlier period. (Fig. 2.5) The ground stone tools of the\\nNeolithic period included different types of axes called ‘celt’. Besides the stone tools,\\nthe sites of this period have also yielded various types of bone objects such as needles,\\nscrapers, borers, arrowheads, pendants, bangles and earrings. (Fig 2.6)\\n22\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\n(c)\\nGeographical Distribution of the Neolithic Sites\\nThe Neolithic sites were spread over almost all the regions of Indian subcontinent.\\n(Map 2.4)  In the northwestern region Mehrgarh is a classic site in the Kachi plains of\\nFig 2.5 Neolithic Age tools\\n23\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\nBaluchistan. The excavations at Mehrgarh have revealed the evidence of houses\\nbuilt by Neolithic people. These were built of sun-dried bricks. These houses were\\ndivided into small rooms. The evidence of cultivation of crops like wheat, barley and\\ncotton were discovered from here. The important sites in Kashmir Valley include\\nFig 2.6 Neolithic Bone tools from Burzahom\\n24\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\nBurzahom and Gufkral. The dwelling pits, either circular or rectangular, at these sites\\nform an important feature of Neolithic culture. The Belan Valley along the edge of\\nVindhyan plateau near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh also has many Neolithic sites such\\nas Koldihwa and Mahagara. The Neolithic tools (both stone and bone), pottery, other\\nartefacts, floral and faunal remains have been found from these sites. In Bihar and\\nmid-Gangetic Valley region Chirand is the most popular Neolithic site. Several Neolithic\\nsites are present covering the hills of Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland. The tools like\\nNeolithic celts, small ground axes alongwith the remains of pottery have been found\\nfrom this area. In South India the Neolithic settlements were discovered along the\\nrivers Bhima, Krishna, Tungabhadra and Kaveri. Some important sites are\\nSanganakallu, Brahmagiri, Maski, Piklihal, Hallur in Karnataka; Utnur, Nagarjunakonda,\\nBudihal in Andhra Pradesh; and Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu.

Millet (Ragi) was one of the earliest crops cultivated by the villagers of\\nSouth India.\\n(d)\\nSubsistence Pattern\\nThe advent of agriculture marked a significant change in Neolithic phase. The\\npeople cultivated various kinds of crops such as wheat, barley, rice, millet, lentils,\\netc,. depending on the geographical conditions. Agriculture gave impetus to ani-\\nmal domestication. Hunting still remained an important occupation. The people\\ndomesticated animals which included sheep, goat, cattle, etc. and also hunted\\nwild animals such as boar, nilgai, gazells, etc. Different kinds of stone tools were\\nmade by Neolithic people, which has already been discussed. The Neolithic people\\nalso manufactured pottery, which was initially hand made and later turned on\\nwheel and fired in large kilns. These were the major means of storage for grains.\\nIn nutshell, we can say that the Neolithic cultures were characterised by change\\nfrom hunting and gathering to cultivation of plants and domestication of animals.\\nThe new polished tools made it easier for humans to cultivate, hunt and perform\\nother activities in a better manner. It led to greater availability of food resources\\nas well as to an increase in population, which in turn resulted in the increase in the\\nnumber of village settlements.

The main subjects of paintings are hunting, fishing and food gath-\\nering. Animals like boar, buffalo, monkey and nilgai are often depicted in these paint-\\nings. (Fig. 2.7) The social activities like the child birth, rearing of a child and burial\\nceremony are also shown in the rock paintings. The scenes of hunting in a group\\nsuggest that Mesolithic people lived in small groups. Thus, we can say that the\\n26\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Geographical Setting and pre-historic\\n Fig 2.7 Prehistoric Art\\nMesolithic society was more stable than the one in Palaeolithic age, though hunting-\\ngathering still remained its main preoccupation.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 2.6\\n1.\\nRock Painting or Rock Art was a distinct feature of which period?\\n2.\\nName the site in Madhya Pradesh which has the maximum number of rock\\npaintings in India.\\n3.\\nPoint out the main subjects highlighted in prehistoric rock art.\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nThe history of India has been greatly influenced by its geographical features and\\nenvironmental conditions.

Later man started using metals. Copper was the first\\nmetal to be used by man for making tools. Gradually several cultures developed in\\nIndian subcontinent which were based on the use of stone and copper tools. They\\nalso used bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, for this purpose. This phase in history is\\nknown as the Chalcolithic chalco-Copper; lithic-Stone) period. The brightest chap-\\nter in the Chalcolithic period in India is the Harappan civilization which is also referred\\nto as the Indus Valley civilization.\\nHarappan civilization was discovered in 1920–22 when two of its most important\\nsites were excavated. These were Harappa on the banks of the river Ravi and\\nMohenjodaro on the banks of the Indus. The first was excavated by D. R. Sahani\\nand the second by R.D. Bannerji. On the basis of the archaeological findings the\\nHarappan civilization has been dated between 2600 B.C–1900 BC and is one of the\\noldest civilizations of the world. It is also sometimes referred to as the ‘Indus Valley\\ncivilization’ because in the beginning majority of its settlements discovered were in\\nand around the plains of the river Indus and its tributaries. But today it is termed as\\nthe Harappan civilization because Harappa was the first site, which brought to light\\nthe presence of this civilization. Besides, recent archaeological findings indicate that\\nthis civilization was spread much beyond the Indus Valley. Therefore, it is better it is\\ncalled as the Harappan civilization. It is the first urban culture of India and is contempora-\\nneous with other ancient civilizations of the world such as those of Mesopotamia and\\nEgypt. Our knowledge of the life and culture of the Harappan people is based only on the\\narchaeological excavations as the script of that period has not been deciphered so far.\\nThe Harappan civilization did not appear all of a sudden. It developed gradually from earlier\\nNeolithic village cultures. It is believed that the better technology to exploit the fertile plains of\\nriver Indus might have resulted in increased agricultural production. This led to the production\\nof larger surplus to feed and maintain non-agricultural people such as artisans, administrators,\\netc. It also helped in the promotion of exchange or trading contacts with distant regions. It\\nbrought prosperity to the Harappan people and they were able to set up cities.\\nBy around 2000 BC several regional cultures developed in different parts of the subcon-\\ntinent which were also based on the use of stone and copper tools. These Chalcolithic\\ncultures which lay outside the Harappan zone were not so rich and flourishing. These\\nwere basically rural in nature. The origin and development of these cultures is placed in\\nthe chronological span between circa 2000 BC–700 BC. These are found in Western\\nand Central India and are described as non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures.\\n31\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  The Harappan Civilization\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nexplain the origin and extent of the Harappan civilization;\\n \\ndescribe the Harappan town-planning;\\n \\nunderstand the Harappan social and economic life;\\n \\ndiscuss the Harappan religious beliefs;\\n \\nexplain how and why did the civilization decline;\\n \\nidentify the Chalcolithic Communities outside Harappan zone;\\n \\nexplain economic condition and settlement pattern of these Chalcolithic commu-\\nnities.\\n3.1 ORIGIN AND EXTENT\\nThe archaeological remains show that before the emergence of Harappan civiliza-\\ntion the people lived in small villages. As the time passed, there was the emergence\\nof small towns which ultimately led to full-fledged towns during the Harappan period.\\nThe whole period of Harappan civilization is in fact divided into three phases: (i)\\nEarly Harappan phase (3500 BC–2600 BC) – it was marked by some town-planning\\nin the form of mud structures, elementary trade, arts and crafts, etc., (ii) Mature\\nHarappan phase (2600 BC–1900 BC) – it was the period in which we notice well-\\ndeveloped towns with burnt brick structures, inland and foreign trade, crafts of vari-\\nous types, etc., and (iii) Late Harappan phase (1900 BC–1400 BC) – it was the\\nphase of decline during which many cities were abandoned and the trade disap-\\npeared leading to the gradual decay of the significant urban traits.\\nLet us first have a glance over the geographical extent of the Harappan civilization.\\nThe archaeological excavations reveal that this culture was spread over a vast area\\nwhich included not only the present day states of India such as Rajasthan, Punjab,\\nHaryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Western Uttar Pradesh but also Pakistan and some\\nparts of Afghanistan. Some important sites of this civilization are: Manda in Jammu and\\nKashmir; Shortughai in Afghanistan; Harappa in Western Punjab (Pakistan); Mohenjodaro\\nand Chanhudaro in Sind; Kalibangan in Rajasthan; Lothal and Dholavira in Gujarat;\\nBanawali and Rakhigarhi in Haryana; Daimabad in Maharashtra while Sutkagendor on\\nthe Makran Coast (near Pakistan-Iran border) is the western most site of the Harappan\\ncivilization and Alamgirpur in western Uttar Pradesh marks its eastern most limit.\\nThe location of settlements suggests that the Harappa, Kalibangan (On R Ghaggar-\\nHakra generally associated with the lost river Saraswati), Mohenjodaro axis was the\\nheartland of this civilization and most of the settlements are located in this region.\\nThis area had certain uniform features in terms of the soil type, climate and subsis-\\ntence pattern. The land was flat and depended on the monsoons and the Himalayan\\nrivers for the supply of water.

It is\\nmarked by considerable uniformity, though one can notice some regional variations as\\nwell. The uniformity is noticed in the lay-out of the towns, streets, structures, brick size,\\ndrains etc. Almost all the major sites (Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Kalibangan and oth-\\ners), are divided into two parts–a citadel on higher mound on the western side and\\na lower town on the eastern side of the settlement. The citadel contain large struc-\\ntures which might have functioned as administrative or ritual centres. The residen-\\ntial buildings are built in the lower town. The streets intersect each other at right\\nangles in a criss-cross pattern. It divides the city in several residential blocks. The\\nmain street is connected by narrow lanes. The doors of the houses opened in these\\nlanes and not the main streets.\\nThe houses of common people, however, differed in size from a single-room house in\\nHarappa to bigger structures. The houses were largely built of burnt bricks. The\\nbigger houses had many rooms surrounding a square courtyard. These houses\\nwere provided with private wells, kitchens and bathing plateforms. The differ-\\nence in the size of the houses suggests that the rich lived in the larger houses\\nwhereas the one-room buildings or barracks might have been intended for the\\npoorer section of the society.\\nThe drainage system of the Harappans was elaborate and well laidout. Every house\\nhad drains, which opened into the street drains. These drains were covered with\\nmanholes bricks or stone slabs (which could be removed for cleaning) were con-\\nstructed at regular intervals by the side of the streets for cleaning. This shows that the\\npeople were well acquainted with the science of sanitation.\\nFig 3.1 Great Bath of Mohenjodaro\\n3.3  SOME MAJOR STRUCTURAL REMAINS OF THE HARAPPAN TOWNS\\nAt Mohenjodaro the ‘Great Bath’ is the most important structure. (Fig 3.1) It is sur-\\nrounded by corridors on all sides and is approached at either end a by a flights of steps in\\nnorth and south. A thin layer of bitumen was applied to the bed of the Bath to ensure that\\nwater did not seep in. Water was supplied by a large well in an adjacent room. There was\\na drain for the outlet of the water. The bath was surrounded by sets of rooms on sides for\\n34\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n The Harappan Civilization\\nchanging cloth. Scholars believe that the ‘Great Bath’ was used for ritual bathing. An-\\nother structure here located to the west of the ‘Great Bath’ is the granary. It consists of\\nseveral rectangular blocks of brick for storing grains. A granary has also been found at\\nHarappa. It has the rows of circular brick platforms, which were used for threshing\\ngrains. This is known from the finding of chaffs of wheat and barley from here.\\nAt Lothal, a brick structure has been identified as a dockyard meant for berthing ships\\nand handling cargo. (Fig 3.2) This suggests that Lothal was an important port and\\ntrading centre of the Harappan people.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 3.2\\n1.\\nThe citadel in Harappan towns was normally located in which direction.\\n2.\\nWhat kind of bricks were used for building the houses?\\n3.\\nWhere was the ‘Great Bath’ discovered?\\n4.\\nName the major structure found at Lothal.\\n3.4 ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\\n(i)\\nAgriculture\\nThe prosperity of the Harappan civilization was based on its flourishing economic activi-\\nties such as agriculture, arts and crafts, and trade. The availability of fertile Indus alluvium\\ncontributed to the surplus in agricultural production. It helped the Harappan people to indulge\\nin exchange, both internal and external, with others and also develop crafts and industries.\\nAgriculture alongwith pastoralism (cattle-rearing) was the base of Harappan economy.\\nThe granaries discovered at sites like Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Lothal served as\\nFig 3.2 The dockyard of Lothal\\n35\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  The Harappan Civilization\\nthe storehouses for grains. We do not have any clear evidence of the tools used for\\nagriculture. However, the furrows or plough-marks have been observed in a field at\\nKalibangan. These indicate plough cultivation. A terracotta plough has also been re-\\nported from Banawali in Hissar district of Haryana. The irrigation was carried on a\\nsmall scale by drawing water from wells or by diverting river water into channels.\\nThe chief food crops included wheat, barley, sesasum, mustard, peas, jejube, etc. The\\nevidence for rice has come from Lothal and Rangpur in the form of husks embedded in pottery.\\nCotton was another important crop. A piece of woven cloth has been found at Mohenjodaro.\\nApart from cereals, fish and animal meat also formed a part of the Harappan diet.\\n(ii)\\nIndustries and Crafts\\nThe Harappan people were aware of almost all the metals except iron. They manu-\\nfactured gold and silver objects. The gold objects include beads, armlets, needles and\\nother ornaments. But the use of silver was more common than gold. A large number\\nof silver ornaments, dishes, etc. have been discovered. A number of copper tools and\\nweapons have also been discovered. The common tools included axe, saws, chisels,\\nknives, spearheads and arrowheads. It is important to note that the weapons pro-\\nduced by the Harappans were mostly defensive in nature as there is no evidence of\\nweapons like swords, etc. Stone tools were also commonly used. Copper was brought\\nmainly from Khetri in Rajasthan. Gold might have been obtained from the Himalayan\\nriver-beds and South India, and silver from Mesopotamia. We also have the evidence\\nof the use of the bronze though in limited manner. The most famous specimen in this\\nregard is the bronze ‘dancing girl’ figurine discovered at Mohenjodaro. (Fig 3.3) It is\\na nude female figure, with right arm on the hip and left arm hanging in a dancing pose.\\nShe is wearing a large number of bangles.\\nBead-making also was an important craft. Beads were made of precious and semi-\\nprecious stones such as agate and carnelian. Steatite was used for making beads.\\nThe evidence of beadmakers’ shops have been found at Chanhudaro and Lothal.\\nGold and silver beads have also been found. Ivory carving and inlaying used in beads,\\nbracelets and other decorations were also in practice. The Harappans thus showed\\ntheir masterly skill in a variety of arts and crafts.\\nFig. 3.3 Dancing Girl Mohenjodro\\n36\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n The Harappan Civilization\\nA well-known piece of art of the Harappan period is a stone sculpture of a bearded\\nman discovered at Mohenjodaro. (Fig 3.4) His eyes are half closed indicating a pos-\\nture of meditation. Across the left shoulder is an embroidered cloak. In the opinion of\\nsome scholars it could be a bust of a priest.\\nA large number of terracotta figurines of males and females have been discovered from\\nvarious Harappan sites. (Fig 3.5) The female figurines outnumber those of males and\\nare believed to represent the worship of mother goddess. Besides these, a variety of\\nmodels of birds, monkeys, dogs, sheep, cattle, humped and humpless bulls are found.\\nHowever, the noteworthy specimen in this regard are various models of terracotta carts.\\nPottery-making was also an important industry in the Harappan period. These were\\nchiefly wheel-made and were treated with a red coating and had decorations in black.\\nThese are found in various sizes and shapes. The painted designs consist of horizontal\\nlines of varied thickness, leaf patterns, palm and pipal trees. Birds, fishes and animals\\nare also depicted on potteries.\\nThe Harappans manufactured seals of various kinds. More than two thousand seals\\nhave been discovered from different sites. These were generally square in shape and\\nwere made of steatite. It is noteworthy that while the seals depict a number of ani-\\nFig. 3.5 Terracota Human & Animal figurines\\nFig 3.4 Stone Sculpture of bearded man\\n37\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  The Harappan Civilization\\nmals there is no representation of horse on these. It has led many scholars to argue\\nthat horse was not known to the Harappan people though there are others who do not\\naccept this argument. Besides various kinds of animals, the Harappan seals contain\\nsome signs in the Harappan script which however has not been deciphered so far.\\nThe most famous of the seals is the one with a horned male deity represented on it.\\nHe has three heads and is sitting in a yogic posture surrounded by four animals viz\\nelephant, tiger, rhinoceros and a buffalo. He has been identified by many scholars\\nwith the ancient form of the god Pashupati (Lord of beasts) though there are others\\nwho dispute this identification.\\nFig 3.7 Seal of Pashupati\\nFig. 3.6 A Terracota cart from Kalibangan\\n38\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n The Harappan Civilization\\n(iii)\\nTrade\\nTrading network, both internal (within the country) and external (foreign), was a\\nsignificant feature of the urban economy of the Harappans. As the urban population\\nhad to depend on the surrounding countryside for the supply of food and many other\\nnecessary products, there emerged a village-town (rural-urban) interrelationship. Simi-\\nlarly, the urban craftsmen needed markets to sell their goods in other areas. It led to\\nthe contact between the towns. The traders also established contacts with foreign\\nlands particularly Mesopotamia where these goods were in demand.\\nIt is important to note that various kinds of metals and precious stones were needed by\\ncraftsmen to make goods, but as these were not available locally they had to be brought\\nfrom outside. The presence of such raw material found at sites away from the place of\\nits origin naturally indicates it must have reached there through an exchange activity.\\nThus Rajasthan region is rich in copper deposits and the Harappans acquired copper\\nmainly from the Khetri mines located here. Kolar gold fields of Karnataka and the\\nriver-beds of the Himalayan rivers might have supplied the gold. The source of silver\\nmay have been Jwar mines of Rajasthan. It is believed that it must have also come from\\nMesopotamia in exchange for the Harappan goods.\\nAmong the precious stones used for making beads, the source of lapis-lazuli was located\\nin Badakshan mines in northeast Afghanistan. Turquoise and Jade might have been brought\\nfrom Central Asia. Western India supplied agate, chalcedony and carnelian. The seashells\\nmust have come from Gujarat and neighbouring coastal areas. Timber of good quality and\\nother forest products were perhaps obtained from the northern regions such as Jammu.\\nThe Harappans were engaged in external trade with Mesopotamia. It was largely\\nthrough Oman and Behrain in the Persian Gulf. It is confirmed by the presence of\\nHarappan artefacts such as beads, seals, dice etc. in these regions. Though the artefacts\\nfrom those regions are rarely found at the Harappan sites, a seal of West Asian or\\nPersian origin has been discovered at Lothal which confirms this contact.\\nMesopotamian cities like Susa, Ur, etc. have yielded about two dozen of Harappan\\nseals. Besides seals, other artefacts of Harappan origin which have been discovered\\ninclude potteries, etched carnelian beads and dices with Harappan features.\\nThe inscriptional evidence from Mesopotamia also provides us with valuable infor-\\nmation on Harappan contact with Mesopotamia. These inscriptions refer to trade\\nwith Dilmun, Magan and Meluhha. Scholars have identified Meluhha with Harappan\\nregion, Magan with the Makran coast, and Dilmun with Bahrain. They indicate that\\nMesopotamia imported copper, carnelian, ivory, shell, lapis-lazuli, pearls and ebony\\nfrom Meluhha. The export from Mesopotamia to Harappans included items such as\\ngarments, wool, perfumes, leather products and sliver. Except silver all these prod-\\nucts are perishable. This may be one important reason why we do not find the re-\\nmains of these goods at Harappan sites.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 3.3\\n1.\\nBesides agriculture which economic activity was practiced by Harappan people?\\n2.\\nName the chief food crops consumed by the Harappans.\\n39\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  The Harappan Civilization\\n3.\\nWhich are the two places from where we get evidence of rice as a food crop\\nduring the Harappan period?\\n4.\\nWhere was the bronze dancing girl found?\\n5.\\nName any two important crafts practised in the Harappan period.\\n6.\\nWhich place was the chief source of copper for the Harappan people?\\n3.5 SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION\\nThe Harappan society appears to have been matriarchal in nature. This view is based\\non the popularity of the mother goddess as indicated by the finding of a large number of\\nterracotta female figurines in Punjab and Sind region. As Harappan script has not been\\ndeciphered till now, we have to satisfy ourselves with this limited information on this issue.\\nThe Harappan Society comprised of people following diverse professions. These in-\\ncluded the priests, the warriors, peasants, traders and artisans (masons, weavers, gold-\\nsmith, potters, etc.) The structural remains at sites such as Harappa and Lothal show\\nthat different types of buildings that were used as residence by different classes. The\\npresence of a class of workmen is proved by workmen quarters near the granary at\\nHarappa. Similarly, the workshops and houses meant for coppersmiths and beadmakers\\nhave been discovered at Lothal. Infact, we can say that those who lived in larger\\nhouses belonged to the rich class whereas those living in the barracks like workmen\\nquarters were from the class of labourers.\\nOur limited knowledge about their dress styles comes from the terracotta figurines and\\nstone sculptures of the period. Men are mostly shown wearing a dress wrapped round the\\nlower half of the body with one end worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm.\\nThe other garment was a skirt like dress to cover the lower portion. They used cotton and\\nwoollen clothes. A piece of woven cloth has been found at Mohenjodaro. Spindles and\\nneedles discovered at many sites attest to the practice of spinning and weaving.\\nHarappan people loved to decorate themselves. Hair dressing by both, men and women,\\nis evident from figurines found at different sites. The men as well as women arranged\\ntheir hair in different styles. The people were also fond of ornaments. These mainly\\nincluded necklaces, armlets, earrings, beads, bangles, etc., used by both the sexes.\\nRich people appear to have used the ornaments of gold, silver and semi-precious\\nstones while the poor satisfied themselves with those of terracotta.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 3.4\\n1.\\nHarappan society is believed to be a \\n society.\\n2.\\nWhere were the workmen’s quarters discovered?\\n3.\\nThe Harappans used clothes made of which material?\\n40\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n The Harappan Civilization\\n3.6 RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES\\nOur knowledge on the religious beliefs and practices of the Harappans is largely based\\non the Harappan seals and terracotta figurines available to us. The Harappan religion is\\nnormally termed as animism i.e., worship of trees, stones etc. (Fig 3.8) A large number\\nof terracotta figurines discovered at the Harappan sites have been associated with the\\nworship of mother goddess. (Fig 3.9) Many of these represent females adorned with a\\nwide girdle, loin cloth and necklaces. They wear a fan-shaped head dress. In some\\ncases the female is shown with an infant while there is one that shows a plant growing\\nout of the uterus of a woman. The latter type probably symbolizes the goddess of earth.\\nThere are many scholars who refer to the worshiping of linga (phallus) and yoni (fe-\\nmale sex organ) by the Harappans but some are doubtful about it.\\nHarappans’ belief in a male deity is evident by the seal depicting a deity with a buffalo-\\nhorned head-dress, sitting in a yogic posture and surrounded by animals. Many scholars\\nidentify him with god Pashupati (Lord of beasts) or ‘Proto-Shiva’ though some dispute it.\\nIn another instance, a deity is shown with horns and flowing hair standing nude between\\nthe branches of a Pipal tree and a worshipper is kneeling in front. It may represent tree\\nworship.  Animal worship also appears to be popular among the Harappans.\\nThe evidence of fire worship has also been found at some sites such as Kalibangan and\\nLothal. At Kalibangan, a series of raised brick platforms with pits containing ash and\\nanimal bones have been discovered. These are identified by many scholars as fire altars.\\nFig 3.9 Mother Goddess from Mohenjodero\\nFig 3.8 Symbolic Pipal Tree from Mohenjodero\\nThis also shows that the Harappans living in\\ndifferent areas followed different religious prac-\\ntices as there is no evidence of fire-pits at\\nHarappa or Mohanjodaro.\\nThe burial practices and the rituals related\\nwith them have been a very important as-\\npect of religion in any culture. However, in\\nthis context Harappan sites have not yielded\\nany monument such as the Pyramids of\\nEgypt or the Royal cemetry at Ur in\\nMesopotamia. Dead bodies were generally\\nrested in north-south direction with their head\\n41\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  The Harappan Civilization\\ntowards north and the feet towards south. The dead were buried with a varying\\nnumber of earthen pots. In some graves the dead were buried along with goods such\\nas bangles, beads, copper mirrors. This may indicate that the Harappans believed in\\nlife after death. At Lothal three joint or double burials with male and female bodies\\ntogether were discovered. Kalibangan has yielded evidence of a symbolic burial along\\nFig. 3.10 Humbed bull seals from Mohenjodero\\ni.e., a burial which contains pots but no bones or skeleton. These different practices in\\ndifferent regions of Harappan civilization may reflect diversity in religious beliefs.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 3.5\\n1.\\nFrom where has the famous “Pashupati” seal been discovered?\\n2.\\nWhich tree is often represented on the Harappan seals?\\n3.\\nIs there any evidence of fire worship? If so where has it been found?\\n4.\\n At which place have joint burials been found?\\n3.9 THE SCRIPT\\nThe Harappans were literate people. Harappan seals, are engraved with various signs\\nor characters. Recent studies suggest that the Harappan script consists of about 400\\nsigns and that it was written from right to left. However, the script has not been\\ndeciphered as yet. It is believed that they used ideograms i.e., a graphic symbol or\\ncharacter to convey the idea directly. We do not know the language they spoke,\\nthough scholars believe that they spoke “Brahui”, a dialect used by Baluchi people in\\nPakistan today. However further research alone can unveil the mystery and enable\\nus to know more about the Harappan script.\\n3.10 DECLINE OF THE HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION\\nThe Harappan Civilization flourished till 1900 BC. The period following this is marked by\\nthe beginning of the post-urban phase or (Late Harappan phase). This phase was\\n42\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n The Harappan Civilization\\ncharacterised by a gradual disappearance of the major traits such as town-planning, art of\\nwriting, uniformity in weights and measures, homogeneity in pottery designs, etc. The\\nregression covered a period from 1900 BC–1400 BC There was also the shrinkage in the\\nsettlement area. For instance, Mohenjodaro was reduced to a small settlement of three\\nhectares from the original eighty five hectares towards the end of the Late phase. The\\npopulation appears to have shifted to other areas. It is indicated by the large number of\\nnew settlements in the outlying areas of Gujarat, east Punjab, Haryana and Upper Doab\\nduring the later Harappan period.\\nYou may be wondering how the Harappan Civilization came to an end. Well scholars\\nput forward many theories in this regard.\\n(i)\\nIt is suggested by some scholars that natural calamities such as floods and earth-\\nquakes might have caused the decline of the civilization. It is believed that earth-\\nquakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the lower course of\\nIndus river. It blocked the passage of the river water to the sea and resulted in\\nthe floods which might have swallowed the city of Mohenjodaro. However, this\\nonly explains the decline of Mohenjodaro and not of the whole civilization.\\n(ii) Increased aridity and drying up of the river Ghaggar-Harka on account of the\\nchanges in river courses, according to some scholars, might have contributed to the\\ndecline. This theory states that there was an increase in arid conditions by around\\n2000 BC. This might have affected agricultural production, and led to the decline.\\n(iii) Aryan invasion theory is also put forward as a cause for the decline. According\\nto this, the Harappan civilization was destroyed by the Aryans who came to India\\nfrom north-west around 1500 BC. However, on the basis of closer and critical\\nanalysis of data, this view is completely negated today.\\nThus, there is no single cause that can explain the decline of the civilization in totality. At\\nthe maximum these can explain the decay of certain sites or areas only. Hence, each\\ntheory has met with criticism. Nevertheless, the archaeological evidence indicates that\\nthe Harappan civilization did not collapse all of a sudden but declined gradually and ulti-\\nmately merged with other local cultures.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 3.6\\n1.\\nWhat is the approximate number of signs found in the Harappan script?\\n2.\\nWhich natural calamities are held responsible for the decline of the Harappan\\ncivilization?\\n3.\\nHow was the Harappan script written?

The\\nevidence of the chalcolithic cultures also comes from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar\\nand Bengal. (Map 3.2) It may be noted that the non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures\\nthough flourished in different regions they were marked by basic uniformity in vari-\\nous aspects such as their mud structures, farming and hunting activities, use of wheel\\nmade pottery etc. The pottery of these chalcolithic cultures included ochre coloured\\npottery (OCP), black-and-red ware (BRW) and has been found in the shape of vari-\\nous kinds of bowls, basins, spouted jars with concave necks, dishes on stand, etc.\\nMap 3.2 Chalcolithic sites\\n44\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n The Harappan Civilization\\n3.12 TOOLS, IMPLEMENTS AND OTHER OBJECTS\\nThe chalcolithic cultures are characterised by the use of tools made of copper as well\\nas stone. They used chalcedony, chert etc. for making stone tools. The major tools\\nused were long parallel-sided blades, pen knives, lunates, triangles, and trapezes. Some\\nof the blade tools were used in agriculture. Main copper objects used include flat axes,\\narrowheads, spearheads, chisels, fishhooks, swords, blades, bangles, rings and beads. Beads\\nmade of carnelian, jasper, chalcedony, agate, shell, etc. frequently occur in excavations. In this\\ncontext, the findings from Daimabad hoard are noteworthy. The discovery includes bronze\\nrhinoceros, elephant, two-wheeled charriot with a rider and a buffalo. These are massive and\\nweigh over sixty kilograms. From Kayatha (Chambal valley) also copper objects with sharp\\ncutting edges have been recovered. These reflect the skills of the craftsmen of the period.\\n3.13 SUBSISTENCE ECONOMY\\nThe people of these settlements subsisted on agriculture and cattle rearing. However,\\nthey also practised hunting and fishing. The main crops of the period include, rice,\\nbarley, lentils, wheat, jawar, coarse gram, pea, green gram, etc. It is to be noted that the major\\nparts of this culture flourished in the zone of black soil, useful mainly for growing cotton.\\nSkeletal remains from the sites suggest the presence of domesticated and wild ani-\\nmals in these cultures. The important domesticated animals were cattle, sheep, goat,\\ndog, pig, horse, etc. The wild animals included black buck, antelope, nilgai, barasinga,\\nsambar, cheetah, wild buffalo and one-horn rhino. The bones of fish, water fowl,\\nturtle and rodents were also discovered.\\n3.14 HOUSES AND HABITATIONS\\nThe Chalcolithic cultures were characterised by rural settlements. The people lived in\\nrectangular and circular houses with mud walls and thatched roofs. Most of the houses\\nwere single roomed but some had two or three rooms. The floors were made of burnt\\nclay or clay mixed with river gravels. More than 200 sites of Jorwe culture\\n(Maharashtra) have been found. The settlements at Inamgaon (Jorwe culture) sug-\\ngests that some kind of planning was adopted in laying of the settlement.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.7\\n1.\\nName one chalcolithic site each in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.\\n2.\\nWhat material was used in the Chalcolithic period to manufacture tools?\\n3.\\nHouses of the Chalcolithic people were made of which material?\\n4.\\nThe chalcolithic cultures were \\n in character.

Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Chanhudaro, Kalibangan, Lothal, Banawali,\\nRakhigarhi and Dholavira were some of the important sites of the Harappan civiliza-\\ntion. Well-planned towns can be observed at some Harappan centres. These towns\\nwere characterised by two broad divisions–a citadel on a higher mound and the lower\\ntown. Burnt bricks were used for building houses. The towns had good drainage\\nsystem. Some major buildings at the Harappan towns were the Great Bath at\\nMohenjodaro, a granary at Harappa, and a dockyard at Lothal. The Harappans prac-\\ntised agriculture alongwith pastoralism. Though there were skilled craftsmen who worked\\nin copper and other metals, the stone tools were still in common use. They produced\\nbeads, terracotta figurines, potteries and seals of various kinds. The Harappans carried\\nout trade, both internal and external. They had commercial links with Mesopotamian\\ncities through Oman and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. The merchants traded in various\\ncommodities of import and export. The Harappan society seems to have been matriar-\\nchal in nature. The people followed different professions such as those of priests, phy-\\nsicians, warriors, peasants, traders and artisans. Though the Harappans wore simple\\nclothes made of cotton and wool, they were fond of decorating themselves with various\\nkinds of ornaments. The Harappans worshipped the mother goddess, Pashupati (Proto-\\nShiva), trees and animals. They also followed different kinds of burial practices and\\nrituals associated with them. The Harappans were literate and their script is in the form\\nof ideograms. However, the script has not been deciphered so far. Once it is deciphered,\\nwe will be able to know more about the Harappan culture. Scholars have suggested\\nvarious factors such as natural calamities, increased aridity, and the Aryan invasion for\\nthe decline of the culture. The archaeological evidence suggests that this civilization did\\nnot face a sudden collapse but had a gradual decline.\\nThe archaeological sources reflect that the non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures were\\ncharacterized by regional variations. The use of stone and copper (Chalcolithic) tools\\nwas the distinct feature of these cultures. The distribution pattern of the sites suggests\\nhierarchy of settlements.

The Harappans lived\\nin cities and had a well organized trade and craft activities. They also had a script which\\nwe have been so far not able to decipher. However around 1900 BC these cities began\\nto decline. A number of rural settlements appeared afterwards. These rural settlements\\nshow continuity of certain Harappan elements. Around the same time we find archaeo-\\nlogical evidence of the arrival of new people known as Aryans or Indo-Aryans on the\\noutskirts of the Harappan region. In the present lesson, we shall study the circum-\\nstances under which these new people arrived and also learn about the main features\\nof their culture as depicted in the literature called the Vedas.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nlearn about the Vedic texts and the nature of their contents;\\n \\nknow about the Aryans and identify the region from where they migrated;\\n \\nlocate the regions inhabited by the Early Vedic (1500BC–1000BC) and the Later\\nVedic people (1000BC–600BC);\\n \\nexplain the importance and impact of the use of iron implements which began in\\nLater Vedic period, and\\n \\nidentify the changes which appeared in the economic, social, religious and politi-\\ncal structures and institutions of the Vedic people over a period extending from\\n1000 BC to 600 BC.\\n 4.1 THE VEDIC TEXTS\\nWhat is veda? The word veda is derived from the root vid which means ‘to know’. The\\nword veda means the sacred knowledge contained in the texts known as Vedic text. Two\\ncategories of texts are included in the corpus of the Vedic literature. These are Mantra\\nand Brahmana. The Mantra category forms the core of the Vedic texts and has four\\nseparate collections. These are the Rigveda, the Samaveda, the Yajurveda, and the\\nAtharvaveda. The Brahmanas not to be confused with Brahaminical class are prose\\ntexts containing the explanations of the mantras as well as the sacrificial rituals. The four\\nVedas together with their Brahmanas are also known as shruti or ‘hearing’, that which\\nwas directly heard by the sages. The Aranyakas (literally forest treatises) and the\\nUpanishads (sitting down beside) are mainly appendices to the Brahmanas. These are\\nalso known as the Vedanta (end of the Veda) and contain philosophical discussions.\\n49\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\nThe Rigveda is a collection of 1,028 hymns divided into 10 mandalas. They are the\\nearliest compositions and hence depict the life of the early Vedic people in India. The\\nSamaveda is a collection of verses mostly taken from the Rigveda but arranged in a\\npoetic form to facilitate singing. The Yajurveda is found in two recensions, Black and\\nWhite, and are full of rituals to be performed publicly or individually. The Atharvaveda\\nis a collection of magic spells and charms to ward off the evil spirits and diseases.\\nCareful studies have shown that the Vedic texts reflect two stages of development in\\nterms of literature as well as social and cultural evolution. The Rigveda which is the\\noldest Vedic text reflects one stage of social and cultural development whereas the\\nother three Vedas reflect another stage. The first stage is known as the Rigvedic period\\nor Early Vedic period and the later stage is known as the Later Vedic period. The age of\\nthe Early Vedic period corresponds with the date of the composition of the Rigvedic\\nhymns. This date has been fixed between 1500 BC and 1000 BC. The later Vedic\\nperiod is placed between 1000 BC and 600 BC. Recently, the Rigveda has been in-\\ncluded by the UNESCO in the list of literature signifying World Human Heritage.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.1\\n1.\\nWhat do you understand by the term Veda?\\n2.\\nWhich texts are included in the Mantra category of the Vedic texts?

Mention them.\\n4.\\nExplain the contents of the Brahmana category of texts.\\n5.\\nExplain the term vedanta.\\n4.2 MIGRATION OF THE ARYANS\\nThe authors of the Vedic hymns were the Aryans. But who were the Aryans? In the\\n19th century, Aryans were considered a race. Now it is thought of as a linguistic\\ngroup of people who spoke Indo-European language from which later emerged San-\\nskrit, Latin, and Greek etc. This is reflected from the words in these languages which\\nare similar in sound and meaning. Thus the Sanskrit words matri and pitri are similar\\nto the Latin mater and pater. Similarly, Inar of the Hittite (Turkey) language is similar\\nto Indra of the Vedas. Suryyas and Maruttash of the Kassite (Mesopotamia) inscrip-\\ntions are equivalent of the Vedic Surya and Marut.\\nOriginally the Aryans seem to have lived somewhere in the Steppes stretching from\\nsouthern Russia to Central Asia. From here, a group of them migrated to northwest\\nIndia and came to be called Indo-Aryans or just Aryans. The archaeological evi-\\ndence of migrations comes from what is known as Andronovo Culture situated in south-\\nern Siberia. This Culture flourished in the second millennium BC. From here people\\nmoved to north of Hindukush (the area known as Bactria-Margiana  Archaeological\\nComplex) and from here they entered India. During the period between 1900 BC\\n50\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\nand 1500 BC we get, in these regions, evidence of horses, spoked wheels, fire cult\\nand cremation which formed important parts of Aryan life in India. Apart from these,\\nthe artifacts and ceramics also suggest movement of people from Central Asian\\nregion to South Asian region. However it may be noted that some scholars still argue\\nthat the Aryans were the indigenous people of India and that they did not come from outside.\\nThe new people came in several batches spanning several hundred years.

This area largely covers the northwestern part of South Asia up to river Yamuna.\\nThe seven rivers included Sindhu, Vitasta (Jhelum), Asikni (Chenab), Parushni (Ravi),\\nVipash (Beas), Shutudri (Sutlej) and the Sarasvati. In this area the Rigvedic people lived,\\nfought battles, grazed their herds of cattle and other domesticated animals. Gradually\\nmoving eastward, they came to occupy eastern U.P. (Kosala) and north Bihar (Videha)\\nduring the Later Vedic period. Here they came into contact with the people who spoke\\nlanguages different from their own and were living in this area for long.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.3\\n1.\\nList the rivers included in the collective term sapta-sindhu.\\n2.\\nWith which regions did the Aryans come into contact in the Later Vedic period?\\n4.4 EARLY VEDIC ECONOMY\\nThe early Vedic Aryans were pastoralists. Cattle rearing was their main occupation. They\\nreared cattle, sheep, goats, and horses for purposes of milk, meat and hides. We arrive at this\\nconclusion after analyzing the literary evidence in the Rigveda. A large number of words are\\nderived from the word go meaning cow. A wealthy person was known as gomat and the\\ndaughter called duhitri which means one who milks the cow. The word gaveshana literally\\nmeans search for cows, but it also means battle since many battles were fought over cattle.\\nThe cows were thought of as providers of everything. Prayers are offered for increase in the\\nnumber of cattle. All the above and many more references show that cattle breeding was the\\nmost important economic activity of the Rigvedic Aryans.\\nHowever, this is not to suggest that the early Vedic people had no knowledge of agricul-\\nture. The evidence for agriculture in comparison with pastoral activities in the early\\n52\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\nportions is meager and mostly late insertions. A few references show that they had\\nknowledge of agriculture and practiced it to supplement their food requirements. They\\nproduced yava (modern jau or barley), which was rather a generic word for cereals.\\nApart from cattle-rearing and small-scale cultivation, people were engaged in many\\nother economic activities. Hunting, carpentry, tanning, weaving, chariot-making, metal\\nsmeltry etc. were some such activities. The products of these activities were exchanged\\nthrough barter. However, cows were the most favoured medium of exchange. The\\npriests received cows, horses and gold ornaments as fees for performing sacrifices.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.4\\n1.\\nDescribe the main occupation of the Early Vedic Aryans.\\n2.\\nMention a few examples which underscore the importance of the cattle.\\n3.\\nHow important was agriculture in the life of the Early Vedic Aryans?

Many\\nrituals were introduced to initiate the process of agriculture. It also speaks of plough-\\ning with yokes of six and eight oxen. The buffalo had been domesticated for the\\nagricultural purposes. This animal was extremely useful in ploughing the swampy\\nland. The god Indra acquires a new epithet ‘Lord of the Plough’ in this period. The\\nnumber and varieties of plant food increased. Apart from barley, people now culti-\\nvated wheat, rice, pulses, lentils, millet, sugarcane etc. The items of dana and dakshina\\nincluded cooked rice. Thus with the beginning of food production agricultural produce\\nbegan to be offered in the rituals. Tila, from which the first widely used vegetable\\nfood-oil was derived increasingly, came to be used in rituals.\\nThe main factor in the expansion of the Aryan culture during the later Vedic period\\nwas the beginning of the use of iron around 1000 BC. The Rigvedic people knew of a\\nmetal called ayas which was either copper or bronze. In the later Vedic literature ayas\\nwas qualified with shyama or krishna meaning black to denote iron. Archaeology has\\nshown that iron began to be used around 1000 BC which is also the period of later Vedic\\nliterature. The northern and eastern parts of India to which the Aryans later migrated\\nreceive more rainfall than the north-western part of India. As a result this region is\\ncovered with thick rain forests which could not be cleared by copper or stone tools used\\nby Rigvedic people. The use of iron tools now helped people clear the dense rain forests\\nparticularly the huge stumps left after burning, in a more effective manner. Large tracts\\nof forestland could be converted into cultivable pieces in relatively lesser time. The iron\\nplough could turn the soil from deeper portions making it more fertile. This process\\nseems to have begun during the later part of the Rigvedic period but the effect of iron\\ntools and implements become evident only towards the end of the Later Vedic period.\\nThere has been a continuous increase in the population during the later Vedic period due\\nto the expansion of the economy based on agriculture. The increasing number and size of\\nPainted Grey Ware (PGW) settlements in the doab area shows this. With the passage of\\ntime the Vedic people also acquired better knowledge of seasons, manuring and irrigation.\\nAll these developments resulted in the substantial enlargement of certain settlements such\\nas Hastinapur and Kaushambi towards the end of the Later Vedic period. These settle-\\nments slowly began to acquire characteristics of towns. Such rudimentary towns inhab-\\nited mainly by the chiefs, princes, priests and artisans were supported by the peasants\\nwho could spare for them some part of their produce voluntarily or involuntarily.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.5\\n1.\\nWhat was the main economic activity during the Later Vedic period?\\n2.\\nWhat changes do we notice in the life of the Aryans with the increased impor-\\ntance of agriculture?\\n3.\\nWho is known as the ‘lord of the plough’?\\n4.\\nWhy is the tila ritually considered very important?\\n54\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\n5.\\nHow did the use of iron implements help agriculture during the Later Vedic pe-\\nriod?\\n6.\\nWhat were the reasons behind the growing sizes of some Painted Grey Ware\\nsites?\\n4.6 THE EARLY VEDIC SOCIETY\\nThe family was the basic unit of the Rigvedic society. It was patriarchal in nature\\nMonogamy was the usual norm of marriage but the chiefs at times practiced po-\\nlygamy. Marriages took place after attaining maturity. After marriage the wife went\\nto her husband’s house. The family was part of a larger grouping called vis or clan.\\nOne or more than one clans made jana or tribe. The jana was the largest social\\nunit. All the members of a clan were related to each other by blood relation. The\\nmembership of a tribe was based on birth and not on residence in a certain area. Thus the\\nmembers of the Bharata tribe were known as the Bharatas. It did not imply any territory.\\nThe Rigvedic society was a simple and largely an egalitarian society. There was no caste\\ndivision. Occupation was not based on birth. Members of a family could adopt different\\noccupations. However certain differences did exist during the period. Varna or colour was\\nthe basis of initial differentiation between the Vedic and non-V\\nedic people. The Vedic people\\nwere fair whereas the non-Vedic indigenous people were dark in complexion and spoke a\\ndifferent language. Thus the Rigveda mentions arya varna and dasa varna. Here dasa\\nhas been used in the sense of a group different from the Rigvedic people. Later, dasa came\\nto mean a slave. Besides, certain practices during this period, such as concentration of larger\\nshare of the war booty in the hands of the chiefs and priests resulted in the creation of some\\ninequalities within a tribe during the later part of this Vedic phase.\\nThe warriors, priests and the ordinary people were the three sections of the Rigvedic\\ntribe. The sudra category came into existence only towards the end of the Rigvedic\\nperiod. This means that the division of society in the early Vedic period was not sharp.\\nThis is indicated by the following verse in the Rigveda: “I am a poet, my father is a\\nphysician and my mother grinds grain upon the stone. Striving for wealth, with varied\\nplans, we follow our desires like cattle.”\\nThe women in society enjoyed respectable position. She was married at a proper age\\nand could choose a husband of her own choice. She could take part in the proceed-\\nings of the tribal assemblies called sabha and samiti.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.6\\n1.\\nDescribe the forms of marriages during the Early Vedic period.\\n2.\\nWas the Early Vedic society egalitarian in nature?

However, its composition under-\\nwent a change. The later Vedic family became large enough to be called a joint-family\\nwith three or four generations living together. The rows of hearths discovered at\\nAtranjikhera and at Ahichchhtra (both in western Uttar Pradesh) show that these were\\nmeant for communal feeding or for cooking the food of large families. The institution of\\ngotra developed in this period. This means that people having common gotra descended\\nfrom a common ancestor and no marriage between the members of the same gotra\\ncould take place. Monogamous marriages were preferred even though polygamy was\\nfrequent. Some restrictions on women appeared during this period. In a text women\\nhave been counted as a vice along with dice and wine. In another text a daughter has\\nbeen said to be the source of all sorrows. Women had to stay with her husband at his\\nplace after marriage. The participation of women in public meetings was restricted.\\nHowever, the most important change was the rise and growth of social differentiation in\\nthe form of varna system. The four varnas in which society came to be divided were the\\nbrahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. The growing number of sacrifices and ritu-\\nals during the period made the brahmanas very powerful. They conducted various rituals\\nincluding those related to different stages of agricultural operations. This made them all the\\nmore important. The kshatriyas, next in the social hierarchy, were the rulers. They along\\nwith brahmanas controlled all aspects of life. The vaishyas, the most numerous varna\\nwere engaged in agriculture as well as in trade and artisanal activities. The brahmanas and\\nthe kshatriyas were dependent on the tributes (gifts and taxes) paid to them by the vaishyas.\\nThe shudras, the fourth varna were at the bottom of the social hierarchy. They were\\nordained to be in the service of the three upper varnas. They were not entitled to the ritual\\nof upanayana samskara (investiture with sacred thread necessary to acquire educa-\\ntion). The other three varnas were entitled to such a ceremony and hence they were\\nknown as dvijas. This can be construed as the beginning of the imposition of disabilities on\\nthe shudras as well as the beginning of the concept of ritual pollution.\\nAnother important institution that began to take shape was ashrama or different stages\\nof life. Brahmacharya (student life), grihastha (householder), and vanaprastha (her-\\nmitage) stages are mentioned in the texts. Later, sanyasa, the fourth stage also came to\\nbe added. Together with varna, it came to be known as varna-ashrama dharma.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.7\\n1.\\nWhat was the nature of the Later Vedic family?\\n2.\\nWhat do you understand by the term gotra?\\n3.\\nWhich term signifies the beginning of the imposition of disabilities on the shudras?\\n56\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\n4.\\nExplain the composite term varnashrama dharma?\\n4.8 THE EARLY VEDIC RELIGION\\nThe prayers to propitiate gods for physical protection and for material gains were the\\nmain concerns of the Rigvedic people. The Rigvedic gods were generally personifica-\\ntions of different aspects of natural forces such as rains, storm, sun etc. The attributes\\nof these gods also reflect the tribal and patriarchal nature of the society as we do not\\nfind many goddesses mentioned in the text. Indra, Agni, Varuna, Mitra, Dyaus, Pushana,\\nYama, Soma, etc. are all male gods. In comparison, we have only a few goddesses such\\nas Ushas, Sarasvati, Prithvi, etc which occupy secondary positions in the pantheon.\\nThe functions of different gods reflect their needs in the society. Thus, since the\\nRigvedic people were engaged in wars with each other they worshipped Indra as a\\ngod. He is the most frequently mentioned god in the Rigveda. He carried the thunder-\\nbolt and was also respected as a weather god who brought rains. Maruts the god of\\nstorm aided Indra in the wars in the way tribesmen aided their leader in the tribal wars.\\nAgni, the fire god was the god of the home and was considered an intermediary be-\\ntween gods and men. Soma was associated with plants and herbs. Soma was also a\\nplant from which an intoxicating juice was extracted. This juice was drunk at sacrifices.\\nVaruna, another important deity, was the keeper of the cosmic order known as rita.\\nThis rita was an important aspect of tribal set-up. Pushan was the god of the roads,\\nherdsmen and cattle. In the life of the pastoral nomads, this god must have been very\\nimportant. Other gods were similarly associated with other aspects of nature and life.\\nAll these gods were invoked and propitiated at yajnas or sacrifices. These sacrifices\\nwere organized by the chiefs of the tribes and performed by priests. Gods thus in-\\nvoked in the sacrifices supposedly rewarded the sacrificers with success in wars,\\nprogeny, increase in cattle and long life. It also brought large number of gifts in the\\nform of dana and dakshina to the priests.\\nIt is important here to note that during the entire Vedic phase people did not construct temples\\nnor did they worship any statue. These features of Indian religion developed much later.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.8\\n1.\\nOn what basis do we say that the attributes of the Rigvedic gods reflect the tribal\\nand patriarchal nature of the society?\\n2.\\nDescribe the main features of the Rigvedic god Indra.\\n       \\n3.\\nWhy did the tribal chiefs organize yajnas?\\n4.\\nWhy was the god Pushan important for the Rigvedic people?\\n5.\\nWhat was the main function of the fire god Agni?\\n57\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\n4.9 CHANGES IN THE LATER VEDIC PHASE\\nWe have already noted that in the later Vedic period agriculture had become an\\nimportant activity of the people. Changes in the material life naturally resulted in a\\nchange in their attitude towards gods and goddesses too. Continuous interactions\\nwith the local non-Aryan population also contributed to these changes. Thus, Vishnu\\nand Rudra which were smaller deities in the Rigveda became extremely important.\\nHowever, we do not have any reference to different incarnations or avataras of\\nVishnu, we are so familiar with, in any of the Later Vedic texts.\\nAnother important feature was the increase in the frequency and number of the\\nyajna  which generally ended with the sacrifices of a large number of animals. This\\nwas probably the result of the growing importance of a class of brahmanas and their\\nefforts to maintain their supremacy in the changing society. These yajnas brought to\\nthem a large amount of wealth in form of dana and dakshina. Some of the impor-\\ntant yajnas were - ashvamedha, vajapeya, rajasuya etc. You must have heard\\nabout these yajnas in the stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. In these\\nyajnas which continued for many days a large part of gifts went to the brahmanas.\\nThe purpose of these yajnas was twofold. Firstly, it established the authority of the\\nchiefs over the people, and secondly, it reinforced the territorial aspect of the polity\\nsince people from all over the kingdom were invited to these sacrifices.\\nYou will find it interesting to know that people began to oppose these sacrifices\\nduring the later Vedic period itself. A large number of cattle and other animals which\\nwere sacrificed at the end of each yajna must have hampered the growth of economy.\\nTherefore, a path of good conduct and self-sacrifice was recommended for happi-\\nness and welfare in the last sections of the Vedas, called the Upnishads. The\\nUpnishads contain two basic principles of Indian philosophy viz., karma and the\\ntransmigration of soul, i.e., rebirth based on past deeds. According to these texts real\\nhappiness lies in getting moksha i.e. freedom from this cycle of birth and re-birth.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 4.9\\n1.\\nWhy did the performance of the yajnas increase in number during the Later\\nVedic period?\\n2.\\nWhat were the purposes of the yajnas?\\n3.\\nExplain the significance of the yajnas ?\\n4.    Why did people begin to oppose the performance of the yajnas?\\n4.10 THE EARLY VEDIC POLITY\\nWe have mentioned above that the chief social unit of the Aryans was known as\\njana. The chief of this unit was the political leader called rajan. The main function\\nof the chief was to protect the jana and cattle from the enemies. He was helped in\\nhis task by the tribal assemblies called sabha, samiti, vidatha, gana and parishad.\\n58\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Vedic Age (1500BC–600BC)\\nOut of these sabha and samiti were the most important assemblies. All aspects of\\nlife were discussed in these assemblies. These may include wars, distribution of the\\nspoils of wars, judicial and religious activities etc. Thus these assemblies in a way\\nlimited the powers of the chiefs. Interestingly, women were also allowed to partici-\\npate in the deliberations of the sabha and samiti.\\nThe post of the chief was not hereditary. The tribe generally elected him. Though the\\nsuccession in one family was known but that was not based on the rule of primogeniture\\n(i.e., the eldest son acquiring the position). The purohita assisted and advised the chief on\\nvarious matters. Other than the purohita, there were a limited number of other officials\\nwho assisted the chief in the day-to-day tribal affairs. Senani, kulapa, gramani, etc. are\\nsome of the functionaries which find mention in the Rigveda.

These people were animal herders and\\nspread out in groups from the Southern Russia to different parts of the world. Many\\nsuch groups reached India through Afghanistan at different periods. Their language,\\nknown as Indo-Aryan or Sanskrit became predominant with borrowings from the\\nlocal languages.Their earliest compositions are known as the Rigveda and many\\nmore compositions followed subsequently. We get to know about the culture of these\\npeople from these collections known as the Vedas.\\nThe Aryans initially lived in the region drained by seven rivers Septa Sindhu roughly\\ncovering the modern states of Punjab, and Harayana. Subsequently they also occu-\\npied the region drained by Ganga, Yamuna, Sarayu, Ghaghra, and Gandaka roughly\\ncovering the modern states of eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar.\\nThe Aryans, who were mainly cattle herders, became agriculturists later, and as-\\nsisted by the knowledge of iron technology they were able to establish larger settle-\\nments in the Ganga- Yamuna doab region. This is shown by the PGW archaeology\\nand the contents of the Later Vedic literature. This change precipitated a series of\\nchanges in the other spheres of life. From an egalitarian, tribal socio-political set up\\nduring the Early Vedic period it was transformed into a varna divided territorially\\nbased set up by the end of the Vedic period. The position of the tribal chiefs became\\nhereditary and the emerging officials usurped the role of the popular assemblies. The\\ngrowing number of yajnas shows the importance of the king as well as of the\\nbrahmanas. Similarly, the gods who were important earlier lost their significance and\\ngave way to new deities. All these changes ultimately resulted in the rise of janapadas\\nand mahajanapadas i.e. bigger territorial states in the sixth century BC.\\nTERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nWho were the Aryans?

In this chapter, we will discuss how\\nincreased agricultural activity and settled life led to the rise of sixteen Mahajanapadas\\n(large territorial states) in north India in sixth century BC. We will also examine the\\nfactors, which enabled Magadh one of these states to defeat all others to rise to the\\nstatus of an empire later under the Mauryas. The Mauryan period was one of great\\neconomic and cultural progress. However, the Mauryan Empire collapsed within fifty\\nyears of the death of Ashoka. We will analyse the factors responsible for this decline.\\nThis period (6th century BC) is also known for the rise of many new religions like\\nBuddhism and Jainism. We will be looking at the factors responsible for the emer-\\ngence of these religions and also inform you about their main doctrines.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to\\n\\uf03d\\nexplain the material and social factors (e.g. growth of agriculture and new social\\nclasses), which became the basis for the rise of Mahajanapada and the new\\nreligions in the sixth century BC;\\n\\uf03d\\nanalyse the doctrine, patronage, spread and impact of Buddhism and Jainism;\\n\\uf03d\\ntrace the growth of Indian polity from smaller states to empires and list the six-\\nteen Mahajanapadas;\\n\\uf03d\\nexamine the role of Ashoka in the consolidation of the empire through his policy\\nof Dhamma;\\n\\uf03d\\nrecognise the main features– administration, economy, society and art under the\\nMauryas and\\n\\uf03d\\nIdentify the causes of the decline of the Mauryan empire.\\n5.1 THE EMERGENCE OF NEW RELIGIONS\\nIn this period, the centre of economic and political activity shifted from Haryana and\\nwestern UP to Eastern UP and Bihar, which had more rainfall and better fertility of\\nland. As it was now easier to exploit the iron ore resources of Bihar and adjoining\\nregions, people started using more and more iron tools and ploughshare to clear thick\\nforest cover and cultivate the hard soil of this area.\\n64\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nThe evidence of the growth of agriculture comes from the archaeological and literary\\nsources of this period. In fact, a ploughshare dated to around 500 BC has been found\\nfrom Jakhera in Etah district in western U.P. Many other important pieces of evi-\\ndence of the use of iron in this period come from Rajghat, Kaushambi, Vaishali and\\nSonpur. The Buddhist texts tell us how cultivation of paddy, sugarcane and mustard\\nrequired utmost care and several rounds of ploughing. Expansion of agriculture re-\\nsulted in improved food supply and helped in the development of craft production,\\ntrade and urban centres.\\nThe sixth century BC is known as an era of ‘Second Urbanisation’ in the\\nIndian Subcontinent. After the decline of the Harappan Towns urban centres\\nnow emerge again after a gap of more than a thousand years. However, this\\ntime towns developed in the middle Ganga basin and not in the Indus plain. It\\nis said that more than sixty towns and cities such as Pataliputra, Rajagriha,\\nSravasti, Varanasi, Vaishali, Champa, Kaushambi and Ujjaini developed be-\\ntween 600 and 300 BC. These cities became centre of craft production and\\ntrade, and were inhabited by a large number of artisans and merchants. The\\ngoods produced by artisans like textile, silk, jewellery, pottery etc, were car-\\nried by merchants to other towns. Varanasi was a major centre of trade con-\\nnected with Sravasti and Kaushambi. Sravasti was also connected with Vaishali\\nthrough Kapilavastu and Kusinara. Jataka stories tell us that traders trav-\\nelled from Magadh and Kosala via Mathura to Taxila. Mathura was the tran-\\nsit point for travel to Ujjain and coastal areas of Gujarat also.\\nDevelopment of trade is reflected in the discovery of thousands of coins\\nknown as punch marked coins (PMC). Various kind of marks such as cres-\\ncent, fish, trees, hill etc. are punched on these coins, they are therefore\\ncalled Punched Marked Coins. Numismatists have identified nearly 550 types\\nof such coins, made mainly of silver and sometimes copper.\\nThe improvement in agriculture and development of trade, money and\\nurbanisation had an impact on the society as well. Indeed, due to these\\nchanges traditional equality and brotherhood gave way to inequality and\\nsocial conflict. People wanted some kind of reprieve from new social prob-\\nlems like violence, cruelty, theft, hatred, and falsehood. Therefore, when\\nnew religions such as Jainism and Buddhism preached the concept of peace\\nand social equality, people welcomed it. These religions emphasised that\\ntrue happiness does not lie in material prosperity or performance of rituals\\nbut in charity, frugality, non-violence, and good social conduct. Besides, the\\ngeneral economic progress had led to the rise of vaisyas and other mercan-\\ntile groups, who wanted better social position than what brahmanas gave\\nthem. Therefore, they preferred to patronise non-vedic religions like Bud-\\ndhism and Jainism through substantial donations.\\nBuddhism and Jainism were not the only religions, which challenged\\nbrahmanical dominance. According to the Buddhist sources, more than 62\\nsects and philosophies flourished in this period. One of these sects was\\nknown as Ajivika, which was founded by Makkhali Goshal. Ajivakas were\\nvery popular in Magadh in the third century BC and Mauryan kings donated\\nseveral caves in the honour of Ajivaka monks.\\n65\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nINTEXT QUESTION 5.1\\n1.\\nName those places where the evidence of iron tools during 6th BC has been found.\\n2.\\nDescribe some important trade routes and trade centres of this period.\\n3.\\nWhy were early coins called punch marked coins?\\n4.\\nWho was the founder of the Ajivika sect?\\n5.2 DOCTRINES OF JAINISM AND BUDDHISM\\nJainism\\nVardhaman Mahavira, is regarded as the founder of Jainism. He was born in 599 BC\\nnear Vaishali in Bihar. He was twenty-fourth and the last tirthankara of Jainism. Jainism\\nbelieved that the main goal of human life is the purification of soul and attainment of\\nnirvana, which means freedom from birth and death. This can be achieved not through\\nrituals and sacrifices but by pursuance of triratna and panchamahavrata. Triratna or\\nthree jewels are right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, which can lead to libera-\\ntion. Right conduct means observance of five great vows: ahimsa (do not commit vio-\\nlence) satya vachana (do not speak a lie), asteya (do not steal), brahmacharya (do\\nnot indulge in sexual act) and aprigraha (do not acquire property). Householders were\\nexpected to observe milder form of the practice of these virtues called anuvrata (small\\nvows) in comparison to the monks. So, one can notice that while the Brahmanism was\\na ritual oriented religion this new faith was conduct-oriented.\\nThe most distinguishing feature of Jainism was the concept of anekantavada or\\nsyadavada. It means that the truth can be viewed from aneka or various angels.\\nAnother important feature of Jainism was its emphasis on extreme form of penance,\\nausterity, and strict non-violence Perhaps emphasis on strict discipline was one of the\\nreasons why it could not attract the masses in large number. Mahavira used Prakrit\\nlanguage to spread his message. However, just like other religions, Jainism also could\\nnot remain united for very long and later divided into two sects called the Digambara\\n(who remain naked) and Svetambara (who wear white clothes).\\nBuddhism\\nThe founder of Buddhism was Gautama Buddha, who was born in 566 BC at\\nLumbini, located in the foothills of Nepal. One night he left his palace in search of\\ntruth and ultimately attained the true knowledge at Bodhgaya. He then began to\\nbe called Buddha or the enlightened one. He delivered his first sermon at Sarnatha\\nnear Varanasi. This event is known as dharma-chakra-pravartana (turning of\\nthe wheel of law). He also established his samgha here. He died at the age of 80\\nin 486 B.C. at Kusinara or Kusinagar near Gorakhpur in eastern UP.\\nBuddha asked his followers to avoid the two extremes of indulgence in worldly plea-\\nsure and the practice of strict abstinence and asceticism. This philosophy of madhyama\\nmarga or the Middle Path is reflected in all the issues related to Buddhism. The main\\n66\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nteachings of Buddhism are encapsulated in the basic concept of four noble truths or\\narya satya and eightfold path or astangika marga. The first noble truth, Buddha said\\nthat suffering (dukkha) is the essence of the world and is like an ocean of miseries.\\nSecond noble truth is dukkha samudya i.e. every suffering has a cause. Third noble\\ntruth is dukkha nirodha i.e. suffering could be extinguished and fourth dukkha\\nnirodha gamini pratipada i.e. there is a path leading to the extinction of dukkha.\\nHe said that every thing in this world like birth, old age and death leads to suffering. If\\none wants to get rid of suffering one has to conquer the desire. This removal of desire\\ncan be achieved through eight fold path, these are: right faith, right resolve, right\\nspeech, right action, right living, right effort, right thought, right self concentration.\\nBuddha used Pali language spoken by masses to propagate his teachings. Buddha allowed\\nlower varnas and women to join the sangha. Four Buddhist councils organised over differ-\\nent periods played a significant role in the propagation of Buddhism. In the fourth council\\nduring the reign of Kanishka, Buddhism split into two major sects called Hinayana and\\nMahayana. Mahayana adopted Sanskrit as its language and started worshipping Buddha in\\nthe form of an idol, while Hinayana continued to follow Pali and treated Buddha as a guide.\\nBuddhism became weak by seventh century AD but the impact of Buddhism can be seen\\nin all spheres of life in Indian history. Buddhist scholars created many literary texts like\\nTripitaka, Milindapanho, Buddhacharita etc. Buddhism became an inspiration for the\\npromotion of art and architecture, in the form of stupas, rock cut caves and paintings.\\nThese can be noticed at Sanchi, Bharhut, Amravati, Ajanta etc. Buddhism inspired\\nGandhara and Mathura schools of art. Buddhism by opening its door to all the classes\\nchallenged the superiority of Brahmanism and gave better social position to lower castes.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 5.2\\n1.\\nWhat are the three elements of the Jaina doctrine of triratna?\\n2.\\nWhat are the two sects of Jainism called?\\n3.\\nWhere did Buddha deliver his first sermon?\\n4.\\nWhat are the four noble truths and eightfold path in Buddhism?\\n5.\\nWhat did Buddha say about dukkha?\\n6.\\nBuddha used which language to preach his words?\\n7.\\nHow are Mahayana and Hinayana different?\\n8.\\nWhat are the contributions of Buddhism in field of literature and art?\\n67\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\n5.3 THE SIXTEEN MAHAJANPADAS\\nThe sixth century BC was not only a period of socio-economic and religious development\\nbut it also witnessed new political developments. In the later Vedic period, as we have\\nseen earlier, people had started agriculture, which made them settle down at a particular\\nplace. These permanent settlements led to foundation of janapadas or territorial states\\nunder the control of the king. In the sixth century BC the main area of political activity\\ngradually shifted from Western UP to Eastern UP and Bihar. This region was not only\\nfertile on account of better rainfall and river systems but was also closer to iron produc-\\ntion centres. The use of better iron tools and weapons enabled some territorial states to\\nbecome very large and they came to be called mahajanapadas. Most of them were\\nsituated north of Vindhyas, between Bihar in the east to the northwest frontier of the\\nsubcontinent. The list of these sixteen mahajanapadas is given below.\\nTable 5.1\\nThe Mahajanpadas\\nMost of these states were monarchical in nature but some of them, called\\nganasangha, had an oligarcharical system of governance. In this system unlike\\nmonarchies, where a hereditary king rules, administration was run by an elected king\\nwith the help of a large council or assemblies comprising heads of all important clans\\nand families.

The earliest important\\nruler of Magadh was the king Bimbisara, who ruled for 52 years from 544 BC to 492 BC. He\\npursued a three-pronged policy, namely, matrimonial alliances, friendship with strong rulers and\\nconquest of weak neighbours to expand the empire. Under the policy of matrimonial alliances,\\nhe married the sister of Prasenjit, the king of Kosala. She brought in dowry the territory of\\nKashi, which yielded a revenue of 1,00,000 coins. The control over Kasi and friendship with\\nPrasenajit allowed Magadh to concentrate on other areas. His other wives were daughters of\\nthe chiefs of Lichchavi and Madra (middle Punjab) respectively. He also conquered Anga by\\ndefeating its ruler Brahmadatta. \\nAnga and specially its capital Champa were important for the\\ninland and maritime trade. Thus, Kashi and conquest of Anga became the launching pad for\\nthe expansion of Magadh. He was a contemporary of both Buddha and Mahavira and paid\\nequal respect to them. It seems that he was either killed or forced to commit suicide by his son\\nAjatasatru, who was eager to take over the throne himself.\\nAjatasatru was an aggressive person and first came into conflict with his maternal uncle\\nPrasenajit, who was aggrieved by the treatment meted out to Bimbisara. He asked\\nAjatasatru to return the territory of Kasi, which was given to his mother in dowry.\\nAjatasatru refused and it was only after a fierce battle Prasenajit agreed to leave Kasi\\nwith Magadh. Similarly he fought with his maternal grandfather Chetak, the chief of\\nVaishali and after 16 long years of war Ajatasatru succeeded in breaking the might of\\nVaishali. Therefore, he not only retained Kasi, but also added Vaishali to Magadh.\\nAjatasatru was succeeded by Udayin and his main contribution was building a fort on the\\nconfluence of river Ganga and river Son at Pataliputra or Patna. It was strategically a\\nsignificant step as this site was not only centrally located but also allowed easy movement\\nof merchant and soldiers.\\nUdayin was succeeded by the dynasty of Shishunaga. The most important achieve-\\nment of Shishunaga was to defeat Avanti(Malwa) and make it a part of Magadh. The\\nsuccessor of Sisunaga was his son Kalashoka. It was during his rule the second\\nBuddhist council was held.\\nThe Shisunaga dynasty was succeeded by the kings of the Nanda dynasty. Mahapadma\\nNanda was its most important ruler. According to the Brahmanical texts he belonged to a\\nlow caste or at least a non-kshatriya caste. He possessed a large army and added Kalinga\\nto his empire. The last Nanda king was Dhannanand. He is believed to be an arrogant and\\noppressive ruler who imposed heavy taxes on the common man. It made them quite\\nunpopular among the masses and ultimately Chandragupta took advantage of this public\\nresentment and uprooted the Nanda rule and set up the Mauryan Empire.\\nThe question is how Magadh could establish gradually its dominance over all other states\\nof the period. Magadh certainly benefited from numerous able and ambitious rulers, but its\\nstrength was based primarily on certain geographical factors. Its earlier capital Girivraja or\\nRajagir was surrounded by five hills, which helped it to provide natural fortification. Sec-\\nondly, its fertile river plain provided a vast amount of agricultural surplus, which was\\nessential for raising a vast standing army. Forests in southern areas gave it timber and\\nelephants. Magadh had another advantage in its control over iron deposits found very\\nnear south Bihar. Such access to iron made Magadhan weapons far superior and agri-\\nculture tools more productive. It was this material background which helped Magadh to\\nbecome more powerful than other mahajanapadas.\\n70\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nINTEXT QUESTION 5.4\\n1.\\nWhat policies were adopted by Bimbisara for the expansion of his kingdom?\\n2.\\nHow did geographical factors play an important role in the rise of Magadh?\\n3.\\nWhat was the name of the old capital of Magadh?\\n4.\\nName two rulers with whom Ajatsatru fought battles?\\n5.\\nWho was the most important ruler of the Nanda dynasty?\\n6.\\nIn whose rule was the second Buddahist council held?\\n5.4 RISE OFTHE MAURYAN EMPIRE\\nMauryan Sources\\nThe establishment of Mauryan dynasty by Chandragupta Maurya in 321 B.C. marks\\na turning point in the history of early India. For the first time now, we have at our\\ndisposal a number of sources which throw better light on the history of this period. The\\nedicts issued by Ashoka are the most important source of information and there are at\\nleast 44 such edicts which have been found inscribed on rocks and pillars. These are\\ncomposed mostly in Prakrit language and are written in Brahmi script in most of the\\nareas. These inscriptions are also the first evidence of writing in ancient India. As far as\\narchaeological sources are concerned, punch-marked coins, remains of the palace of\\nAshoka at Kumharar and several pieces of sculptures are important.\\nThe most important literary sources are Arthasastra of Kautilya and Indica of\\nMegasthenes. Arthasastra is a text on statecraft, which gives advice to kings as to how\\nto rule his land and discharge his duties. Indica is an account left by a Greek ambassador\\nMegasthenes sent by Seleucus to the court of Chandragupta Maurya.

His son Bindusara (297–269BC) suc-\\nceeded him. He promoted trade and cultural interaction with Greeks, but not much is\\nknown about him. Ashoka (269–232BC) succeeded his father Bindusara. According\\nto Buddhist traditions he came to throne after killing his 99 brothers, but such stories\\ncannot be trusted without confirmation from other sources. Ashoka fought a major\\nwar with Kalinga around 261 BC in which large number of people were killed or\\nimprisoned. Perhaps this bloodshed moved his heart and he decided to abandon the\\nMap 5.2 The Empire of Ashoka\\n(Chennai)\\n(Kolkata)\\n(Mumbai)\\n72\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\npolicy of military expansion and declared that he would in future favour dhammaghosha\\n(drum of dhamma) than bherighosha (war drum). He spent the rest of his life in\\npromoting and spreading the policy of Dhamma.

He is praised not\\nso much for his militaristic activity as for his policy of Dhamma. According to some of\\nscholars Ashoka was a follower of Buddhism and through Dhamma he tried to propa-\\ngate the principles of Buddhism But this does not seem to be true as Dhamma had\\nnothing to do with the propagation of Buddhism. It was a code of conduct or ideal\\nsocial behaviour common to all religions of the world, which he appealed to his sub-\\njects to follow. Although Ashoka himself believed in Buddhism, he never discrimi-\\nnated against other faiths or religions.\\nA closer look at Asokan edicts illustrates that basic attributes of Dhamma included\\ncompassion (daya), charity (dana), truthfulness, purity and gentleness. Pillar Edict\\nIII asks subjects to control violence, cruelty, anger and envy. Rock edict I call for a\\nban on animal sacrifice and social gatherings like samaj. The Rock Edict II declares\\nmeasures to be taken for the construction of hospitals, roads, inns, wells and planting\\nof shade giving trees. Third, Fourth and Twelfth rock edicts ask people to respect\\nparents, relatives, brahmanas and shramanas(monks). He also appointed a special\\ntype of officials called dhamma mahamatras. Their main function was to over see\\nand supervise the peaceful function of the principles of Dhamma. Twelfth rock edict\\nis specially important since it says “ the king Piyadassi, the beloved of the gods, respected\\nall sects whether ascetics or householders, and he honours them with gifts and honours of\\nvarious kinds…let an alien sect also be respected on every occasion.” It shows clearly\\nthat neither Dhamma was Buddhism nor Ashoka was trying to convert people to Bud-\\ndhism. However, the question is why did he give so much attention to this policy?\\nHistorians believe that by the later half of Ashoka’s rule, expansion of the empire was\\nalmost complete. It was an empire having different cultural, social and religious groups.\\nIn order to save the empire from political tensions arising out of these differences\\nthere were two ways. He could either increase the size of armed forces to seek\\nmilitary solutions to these conflicts, which might have needed increased taxes and in\\nturn could lead to more resistance. Another alternative was peaceful resolution of\\n73\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nvarious conflicts by cementing and welding of divergent groups. Ashoka chose the\\nsecond alternative in order to promote harmony and peace in his kingdom. Ashoka\\nFig. 5.2 Ashoka’s Pillar edict\\nthus has an important place in Indian history because he was the first king to initiate\\npolicies of peace rather than of war and aggression.\\n74\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nINTEXT QUESTION 5.6\\n1.\\nWhat do Ashokan inscriptions tell us about Dhamma?\\n2.\\nWhat was the attitude of Ashoka towards other religions?\\n3.\\nWhat was the function of the dhammamahamatras?\\n5.7  DECLINE OFTHE MAURYAS\\nMauryas maintained a huge army, a vast bureaucracy and ruled over a large part of\\nthe Indian subcontinent. But soon after the death of Ashoka the empire got divided\\ninto two parts. While king Dasaratha controlled the eastern part of the empire, the\\nwestern part was under Samprati. Why did such a large empire decline so early?\\nSome historians believe that Ashoka under the influence of Buddhism became a paci-\\nfist and weakened his army. It is also said that the religious policy of Ashoka antagonised\\nthe brahmanas as he banned the animal sacrifice, which affected the economic and\\nreligious activities of the brahmanas. Therefore, Pusyamitra, the brahmana chief of\\nthe army, killed the last Mauryan king. But this does not seem to be correct as the\\nstudy of Ashokan inscriptions reveals that Ashoka paid full respect to brahmanas.\\nMoreover it is true that Ashoka followed a policy of peace and harmony, but he did\\nnot disband his army and was always prepared to face any eventuality.\\nOne of the main reasons for decline could be the succession of weak rulers.\\nWho could not keep under check those, ministers and officials of far-flung re-\\ngions, who had become oppressive and acted against the interest of the centre. It\\nis also possible that Mauryan rule may have suffered some kind of economic\\ncrisis. It is reflected in the debasement of some coins of that period. This crisis\\nmight have developed either due to massive donations and charity or overspend-\\ning on the imperial administrative system. In fact, the reason of decline was\\ninherent in the structure of the vast centralized empire itself. The successors of\\nAshoka could not maintain the balance between the centre and the various pro-\\nvincial governors of the empire, and at the first possible opportunity, they made\\nan effort to separate themselves from the centre. However, Mauryan empire\\nthough declined had a positive effect of spreading agriculture and iron technol-\\nogy in the different parts of the subcontinent. It facilitated the rise of several\\nregional kingdoms in the post-Mauryan period.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 5.7\\n1.\\nHighlight the important reasons for the decline of the Mauryan empire.\\n2.\\nWho ruled two parts of empire after the death of Ashoka?\\n75\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\n3.\\nWhat was the impact of Mauryan rule on the subsequent history of India.\\n5. 8 INDIA UNDER THE MAURYAS\\nAdministration\\nThe Mauryas established an elaborate system of administration in which king played\\nthe chief role. He was assisted by a council of ministers but the king himself took all\\nfinal decisions regarding revenue, law and order, war or any other matter related to\\nadministration. He was expected to be agile and accessible to his officials at all times.\\nIn the one of his rock edicts Ashoka declared that even common people could meet\\nMap 5.3 Maurya Empire\\nA\\n76\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nhim any time. He also declared that all his subjects were like his children and he\\ndesired their happiness in this and the other world.\\nThe king appointed a council of ministers called mantriparishad. There were various\\nother officials, who helped him perform his duties. These officials were known as\\namatyas, mahamatras and adhayakshas. Arthasastra gives a list of 27 adhayakshas\\nor superintendents who were responsible for running various economic departments\\nlike agriculture, mining, weaving, trade, etc.\\nAmong all the executive officials samaharta was the most important. His responsibility was\\nto supervise collection of taxes from all types of sources. Most of the superintendents men-\\ntioned above, functioned on his orders. The Mauryas also employed a large number of spies.\\nThe Mauryans maintained a huge army and according to Greek writer Justin,\\nChandragupta had 6,00,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 9,000 elephants, 8,000 chariots.\\nAlthough, it seems to be an exaggerated figure but possession of a large army by the\\nMauryas cannot be doubted. Megasthenes reports that administration of different\\nbranches of army was carried out through six committees of five members each. An\\nofficer called antahpala was responsible for the security of frontier forts.\\nAs far as judicial administration is concerned, the king was the supreme authority, but various\\ncivil as well as criminal courts functioned at the local level right from village to province. It\\nseems most of the cases were disposed off at the village level by village elders.\\nApart from Magadh with its capital at Patliputra, the Mauryan Empire was divided\\ninto four other provinces with capitals at Taxila (northwestern India), Suvarnagiri\\n(southern India), Tosali (eastern India) and Ujjain (western India). These were put\\nunder the control of royal princes called kumara.\\nThe city administration of Patliputra, according to Megasthenes, was conducted by\\nsix committees of five members each. Each committee was assigned different sub-\\njects such as industry, foreigners, birth and death registration, trade and market regu-\\nlations and tax collection to look after. However, we are not sure whether the entire\\nIndian subcontinent had similar type of city administration. It seems that while central\\nprovince of Magadh was under strict supervision of the king, other far-flung areas\\nmight have witnessed varied degree of administrative control.\\nEconomy, Society and Art\\nThe Mauryas as mentioned above maintained a huge standing army and employed a large\\nnumber of state officials. These soldiers and officials were paid in cash. \\nAs the normal taxes\\nwere not considered sufficient to meet all the needs of the state and hence the state under-\\ntook and regulated numerous economic activities to generate more and more resources.\\nThe mainstay of economy in this period was agriculture. The Mauryan state founded\\nnew agricultural settlements to bring virgin land under cultivation. People from overpopu-\\nlated areas and prisoners of war were brought to these new settlements to work on the\\nfields. These villages belonged to king and were looked after by government official called\\nsitadhyaksha or superintendent of agriculture. Besides state farms there were individual\\nland holders who paid a variety of taxes to the state. The importance of irrigation was fully\\nrealised and peasants had to pay more tax on irrigated land. The bali or land tax was the\\nmain item of revenue, levied at the rate of one sixth of the produce. Peasants had to pay\\nmany other taxes like pindakara, hiranya, bhaga, bhoga etc. The exact nature of\\nwhich is not clear. Principal crops were various varieties of rice, barley, millet, wheat,\\nsugarcane and most of the pulses, peas and oilseeds, which we know today.\\n77\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nTrade and urban economy received great impetus under the Mauryas and influenced\\nalmost all parts of the empire. The main centres of textile manufacturing were Varanasi,\\nMathura, Bengal, Gandhara and Ujjain. Mining and metallurgy was another important\\neconomic activity. Trade was conducted through land and river routes. Patliputra was\\nalso connected through various trade routes with all parts of the subcontinent. The\\nmain centre of trade in the northwest was Taxila, which was further connected with\\ncentral Asian markets. Tamralipti (Tamluk in west Bengal) in the east and Broach in\\nthe west were important seaports.\\nCraft activities were also a major source of revenue to the state. Artisans living in\\ntowns had to pay taxes either in cash or kind or work free for the king. Traders and\\nartisans were organised in associations called srenis or guilds. The Mauryas were\\nresponsible for introduction of iron on a large scale in different parts of the subconti-\\nnent. They maintained a monopoly over production of iron, which was in great de-\\nmand by the army, industry and agriculture. It was done through the official called\\nloha-adyaksha.\\nAs far as society is concerned, despite the challenge posed by Buddhism and Jainism\\nthe varna system continued to exist and brahmanas and kshatriyas dominated the\\nsocial hierarchy. However, as a result of greater trade and commerce, there was\\nimprovement in the social status of vaisyas or trading communities and shudras. Now\\nshudras could be involved in the agricultural and artisanal activities. This period also\\nsaw increase in the number of untouchables.\\nThe Mauryan period provides the earliest examples of ancient Indian art and\\narchitercture. Megasthenes has described the grandeur of the Mauryan palace\\nat Pataliputra. Some remains of this palace have been found at Kumrhar near\\nPatna. Ashokan pillars at Rampurva, Lauriya Nandangarh and Sarnath present\\nexcellent examples of stone sculptures which developed in this period. Our na-\\ntional emblem comes from the Asokan pillar at Sarnath near Benaras. All these\\npillars are circular and monolithic, and are made of sand stone found at Chunar,\\nnear Mirzapur in U.P. We also find some rock cut architecture like Lomasa Risi\\ncave in the Barabara hills near Gaya belonging to the Mauryan period. Among\\nseveral stone and terracotta sculptures of this period, polished stone sculpture of\\na chauri-bearing female known as Didarganj Yakshini is most famous.\\nFig. 5.3 Sarnath Pillar\\n78\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\nINTEXT QUESTION 5.8\\n1.\\nWhich Mauryan officer was responsible for the assessment and collection of\\ntaxes?\\n2.\\nWhich officer looked after the cultivation of the land owned by the king?\\n3.\\nWhat is the name of rock cut cave in the Barabar hills near Gaya?\\nWHATYOU HA\\nVE LEARNT\\nThe use of iron tools and cattle-power in the fertile middle Ganga plain led to the\\nincrease of agricultural productivity and the food supply in the sixth century BC. This\\ndevelopment of agriculture resulted in growth of towns, trade and money economy.\\nThat is why the sixth century B.C. is also known as a period of ‘second urbanisation’.\\nIn this period, some non-vedic religions like Buddhism and Jainism responded to the\\nnew social realities and argued for a ban on cattle sacrifice, money-lending and urban\\nlifestyle. They advocated better social status for trading communities, who in turn\\nFig. 5.5 Didarganj Yakshini\\nFig. 5.4 Cave in the Barbara Hills\\n79\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nFrom Janapadas to Empire\\npatronised these new religions. The main teachings of Jainism are triratna and\\npanchamahavrata, while Gautam Buddha asked people to follow four noble truths\\nand eight-fold path. The Janapadas of earlier times consolidated in this period and\\nresulted in the rise of sixteen mahajanapadas. Some janapadas followed the non-\\nmonarchical system of governance. Ultimately, the utilisation of favourable geographical\\ncondition by the ambitious rulers of Magadh resulted in its rise as an empire. Later on\\nMauryas uprooted the Nanda dynasty and established their rule. They maintained a\\nhighly centralised bureaucracy along with a vast army, and administered a large part\\nof the Indian Subcontinent. One of the greatest Indian rulers Ashoka adopted the\\npolicy of Dhamma, which was aimed at consolidation of the empire and resolving\\ninternal conflicts through peaceful means.

In around 187 BC, the Mauryan Empire met its end. In the present\\nsection we shall study about the political and cultural developments in the Indian\\nsubcontinent from the end of the Mauryas to the rise of the Guptas, i.e., from\\nBC 200 and 300 AD. In these five hundred years we see not only the rise of multiple\\npolitical powers in different parts of the subcontinent but also the introduction of new\\nfeatures in art, architecture and religion.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to learn about\\n \\nthe different political regions which came into focus after the decline of the\\nMauryan Empire\\n \\nthe groups of foreigners who came from Central Asia and got settled here;\\n \\nthe growth of trade between the Roman world and India and its impact.\\n \\nimportant features of various schools of art and sculptures which emerged dur-\\ning 200 BC–300 AD and\\n \\nthe early history of south India and the significance of the Sangam literature.\\n6.1 POLITICAL HISTORY OF NORTH INDIA\\nThe disintegration of the Mauryan empire led to the rise of many regional kingdoms in\\ndifferent parts of the country. At the same time, we witness invasions by various groups of\\npeople based in Central Asia and western China. These were Indo-Greeks, the Scythians or\\nthe Shakas, the Parthians or the Pahlavas and the Kushanas. It was through such political\\nprocesses that India came in closer contact with the central Asian politics and culture.\\n(i)\\nThe Shungas\\nThe last Mauryan king was killed by his Commander-in-Chief, Pushyamitra Shunga,\\nwho then established his own dynasty in north India. It came to be known as Shunga\\ndynasty. While the Shungas were ruling in north India, the Indo- Greeks also known\\nas Yavanas, about whom we shall study in some details later, emerged in Bactria\\n(Balkh) as an independent power and soon started extending their rule in the north-\\nwestern and northern parts of India. There are indications that Pushyamitra Shunga\\n83\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\ncame in conflict with Demetrius, a Bactrian Greek ruler without suffering much politi-\\ncal damage. An inscription engraved on a pillar at Besnagar (present day Vidisha)\\nrefers to one Heliodorus, native of Taxila near Rawalpindi in Pakistan, as an envoy of\\nan Indo-Greek ruler Antialkidas in the court of Bhagabhadra, who has been identified\\nwith one of the later Shunga rulers. According to the inscription he was devotee of\\nLord Krishna.\\nIn around the second quarter of the first century BC, the last of the Shunga rulers was\\nkilled treacherously by his minister Vasudeva, who then laid down the foundations of\\nthe Kanva dynasty. We know virtually nothing about the Kanvas except for the rather\\ncursory references to them in later texts.\\n(ii)\\nThe Bactrians or the Indo-Greeks\\nAfter the death of Alexander in 323 BC, many Greeks came to settle on the northern\\nwestern boarders of India with Bactria (area to the north-west of the Hindukush\\nmountains in the present day north Afghanistan) as an important centre. The rulers of\\nBactria came to be called the Bactrian-Greeks because of their Hellenistic (Greek)\\nancestry. One of the rulers of the line named Demetrius as mentioned above came\\ninto conflict with Pushyamitra.\\nHowever, the most celebrated Indo-Greek ruler was Menander. His empire appears\\nto have included southern Afghanisthan and Gandhara, the region west of the R.\\nIndus. He has been identified with king Milinda mentioned in the famous Buddhist\\ntext Milindapanho which contains philosophical questions that Milinda asked\\nNagasena (the Buddhist author of the text) and informs us that impressed by the\\nanswers, the king accepted Buddhism as his religion. Menander is believed to have\\nruled between c. 155 BC and 130 BC.\\n(iii)\\nThe Shakas\\nShaka is the Indian term used for the people called Scythians, who originally belonged\\nto central Asia. Defeated by their neighbours the Yueh-chis (the tribal stock to which\\nthe Kushanas belonged) they gradually came to settle in northwestern India around\\nTaxila in the first century B.C Under the successive Shaka rulers their territories\\nextended up to Mathura and Gujarat.\\nThe most famous of all the Shaka rulers was Rudradaman who ruled in the middle of\\nsecond century AD. His empire was spread over almost whole of western India. His\\nachievements are known through the only inscription that he got engraved on a boul-\\nder at Girnar or Junagarh. This inscription happens to be the first royal inscription of\\nearly India composed in chaste Sanskrit.\\n(iv)\\nThe Parthians\\nThe Parthians were of Iranian origin and because of strong cultural connection with\\nthe Shakas, these groups were referred to in the Indian sources as Shaka-Pahlava.\\nThe important inscription indicating the Parthian rule in northwestern area of Pakistan\\nis the famous Takht-i-Bahi inscription recovered from Mardan near Peshawar. The\\ninscription, dated in 45 AD, refers to Gondophernes or Gondophares as a Parthian\\nruler. Some literary sources associate him with St. Thomas, who is said to have con-\\nverted both, the king and his brother, to Christianity.\\n84\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n Post Mauryan Developments\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 6.1\\n1.\\nWho was the last Mauryan King\\n2.\\nWho was Heliodorus?\\n3.\\nWhich Indo-Greek king has been identified with king Milinda of the famous\\nBuddhist text Milindapanho?\\n4.\\nWhich inscription happens to be the first royal inscription of early India com-\\nposed in chaste Sanskrit?\\n5.\\nThe Shakas were the natives of which region?\\n6.2 THE KUSHANAS\\nThe Kushanas, originally belonged to western China. They are also called Yueh-chis. The\\nKushanas after defeating Shakas and Pahlavas created a big empire in Pakistan. The first\\nprominent ruler of the Kushana dynasty was Kujula Kadphises. He was succeeded by his\\nson Wema Kadphises. Next ruler was Kanishka. He was the most famous of the Kushanas.\\nHe probably ascended the throne in AD 78, and started a new era, now known as the Shaka\\nera. It was under Kanishka that the Kushana empire reached its maximum territorial limits.\\nHis empire extended from Central Asia to north India and included Varanasi, Kaushambi\\nand Sravasti in Uttar Pradesh. The political significance of Kanishka’s rule lies in the fact\\nthat he integrated central Asia with north India as part of a single empire. It resulted in the\\nintermingling of different cultures and increase in inter regional trading activities.\\nKanishka is famous in history as a great patron of Buddhism. He convened the fourth\\nBuddhist Council at Kundalavana (present day Harwan near Srinagar in Jammu and\\nKashmir) in which a large number of Buddhist scholars took part. It was in this council\\nthat Buddhism got split into two schools – Hinayana and Mahayana. Kanishka also pa-\\ntronized the Gandhara and Mathura schools of sculptural art about which you will learn\\nlater in this chapter. He built in the city of Purushpura (present day Peshawar), his capital,\\na giant stupa to house the Buddha’s relics. The building was still intact with all its magnifi-\\ncence when the Chinese pilgrim Fa-hsien visited the area later in the early fifth century\\nAD. The Kushana power gradually declined from the early third century AD.\\n(i)\\nKushana Polity and Administration\\nNothing much is known about the administrative machinery of the Kushanas. Per-\\nhaps the whole empire was divided into provinces, each ruled by a mahakshatrapa\\n( a military governor), who was assisted by a kshatrapa; but how many provinces\\nwere there in the empire, is not known. Sources indicate that Kushana horsemen\\nwore trousers while riding. A headless statue of Kanishka found at Mathura reflects the\\nsame. A prominent feature of Kushana polity was the title of devaputra, i.e., son of\\nGod, used by the Kushana kings. It indicates the claim to divinity by the Kushana kings.\\n85\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\n(ii)\\nContribution of the Kushanas\\nThe Kushanas occupy a special place in the ancient Indian history because of their\\ncontribution to various aspects of life. Their vast empire helped in the growth of\\ninternal and external trade. It resulted in the rise of new urban centres. The rich state\\nof economy under the Kushanas is also evidenced by the large number of gold and\\ncopper coins that they struck.\\nEven in literature and medicine, India made progress. Charaka, known as father of\\nAyurveda, wrote a book on medicine called Charaksamhita whereas Asvaghosha, a\\nBuddhist scholar, wrote Buddhacharita, a full length biography of the Buddha. Both\\nthese scholars were believed to be the contemporaries of king Kanishka. The Kushanas\\npatronized the Gandhara and the Mathura schools of sculptural art which are known\\nfor producing the earliest images of Buddha and Buddhisattavas.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 6.2\\n1.\\nWho was the most prominent Kushana ruler?\\n2.\\nWho started the Shaka era and when?\\n3.\\nWhere and under whose patronage did the fourth Buddhist council took place?\\n4.\\nWho was Charaka?\\n6.3 CONTACTS WITH CENTRAL ASIA\\nInvasions of the Bactrian Greeks and Saka-Pahilavas on India and its subsequent\\npolitical contact with Central Asia under the Kushanas resulted in immense cul-\\ntural intermingling between the two regions. These foreign groups gradually lost\\ntheir foreign identity and were incorporated in the Brahmanical society lower\\ngrade as kshatriyas. Many of them adopted Buddhism. We have already re-\\nferred to the Indo-Bactrian ruler Menander who was converted to Buddhism by a\\nmonk named Nagasena.\\nCentral Asian contacts also brought to India new methods of making coins. The crude\\npunch-marked coins which were used earlier gradually gave way to refined Greek\\nstyle coins containing legends and the bust of the ruler. This new format became the\\nmodel for the subsequent coinage in India. Besides, Indians also borrowed from cen-\\ntral Asians, particularly the Greeks, knowledge of astronomy. Early Indian literary\\nworks on astronomy frequently quote the Greek astronomers who are referred to as\\nyavanacharya. Indians also learned the art of making horoscopes from the Greeks.\\nCentral Asian contacts brought a fresh wave in the art of sculpture making. Buddhist\\nsculptures of the Gandhara school, as explained here below, evolved as a result of the\\namalgamation of the Indian and the Greek styles.\\n86\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n Post Mauryan Developments\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 6.3\\n1.\\nWhat were the main features of the Greek style coins?\\n2.\\nWhich term was used for Greek astronomers in early Indian Literature?\\nCENTRAL ASIAN\\nCONTACTS\\n(C200 BC - AD 300)\\nA R A L\\nS E A\\nSOGDIANA\\nFARGHANA\\nPARTHIA\\nARIA\\nGEDROSIA\\nARABIAN SEA\\nI N D I A\\nP U N J A B\\nBACTRIA\\nKAPSIA\\nGANDHARA\\nKABUL\\nBAMIYAN\\nKANDHAR\\nA R A C H O S I A\\nIndus\\nTAXILA\\nPURUBHAPUR\\nPresent Indian Boundary\\nMap 6.1 Central Asian Contacts\\nc\\n87\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\n6.4 EMERGENCE OF EARLY STATES IN ORISSA AND THE DECCAN\\nWe know that the Deccan as well as eastern India were parts of Ashoka’s empire.\\nHe had conquered Kalinga through a violent battle in which loss of men and property\\nwas enormous.

Gautamiputra Satakarni (first century AD) is considered to be the great-\\nest of the Satavahana rulers. He is credited with the extension of Satavahana dominions\\nby defeating Nahapana, the Shaka ruler of Western India. His kingdom is said to have\\nextended from river Krishna in south to river Godavari in north. The Satavahanas had their\\ncapital at Pratishthana (modern Paithan) near Aurangabad in Maharashtra.\\nThe Satavahana kingdom was wiped out in the first quarter of the third century AD\\nand the Satavahanas kings were succeeded by the Kings of lkshvaku dynasty.\\nSatavahana Polity and Adminstration\\nSatavahana kingdom was divided into subdivisions called aharas or rashtras, meaning\\ndistricts. The lowest level of administration was a grama which was under the charge of\\na Gramika. There were also officers called amatyas who were perhaps ministers or\\nadvisors of the king. Revenue was collected both in cash and kind. Satavahanas kings\\nwere the first in Indian history to make tax free land grants to Buddhists and Brahmanas\\nto gain religious merit.

There were two major internal land\\nroutes in ancient India. First, known as Uttarapatha, connected northern and eastern\\nparts of India with the northwestern fringes, i.e., present day Pakistan and further\\nbeyond, and the second, known as Dakshinapatha, connected the peninsular India\\nwith the western and northern parts of India.\\nThe Dakshinapatha was the major route that connected north and south India. It\\nstarted from Kaushambi near Allahabad and running through Ujjaiyini (modern Ujjain)\\nextended further up to Bhrigukaccha or Broach, an important port on western coast.\\nThe Dakshinapatha was further connected with Pratishthana (modern Paithan), the\\ncapital of the Satavahanas.\\nAs regards external trade routes, after the discovery of monsoons by Hippatus a\\nGreek navigator in 45 AD, more and more sea voyages were used for trading pur-\\nposes. Important ports of India on the western coast were (from north to south direc-\\ntion) Bharukachchha Sopara, Kalyana, Muziris, etc. Ships from these ports sailed to\\nthe Roman Empire through the Red Sea.\\nTrade with southeast Asia was conducted through the sea. Prominent ports on the eastern\\ncoast of India were Tamralipti (West Bengal), Arikamedu (Tamil Nadu Coast) etc. Sea\\ntrade was also conducted between Bharukachchha and the ports of Southeast Asia.\\n(ii)\\nTrade with West and Central Asia\\nAn important feature of the commercial activities in the post-Mauryan period was the\\nthriving trade between India and the West, where the Roman empire was at its height.\\nInitially this trade was carried out through land, but owing to frequent obstructions\\ncreated by the Persians, who ruled the areas through which these trade routes passed,\\nthe focus was shifted to sea routes. Now ships could move directly from Indian ports\\nto the ports on Red Sea and Persian Gulf.\\nThe best account of Indo-Roman trade is given in the book called Periplus of the\\nErythrean Sea which was written in the first century AD by an anonymous author.\\nMain requirements of the Romans were the Indian products such as spices, per-\\nfumes, jewels, ivory and fine textiles, i.e. muslin. Spices exported from India to the\\nRoman empire included pepper, also called yavanapriya (perhaps because of its\\npopularity among Romans). The spice trade with the Roman empire was largely\\nbased in south India. Romans also imported several precious and semiprecious stones\\nlike diamond, carnelian, turquoise, agate, sapphire etc, besides pearls, indigo, sandal-\\nwood and steel etc.\\n90\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n Post Mauryan Developments\\nAgainst this import Romans exported gold and silver to India. It is proved by a large\\nnumber of Roman coins of the first century AD found in the subcontinent. This indicates\\nan enormous drain of gold from the Roman empire towards India. Other important\\nitems of export from the Roman empire included wine which is indicated by wine-\\namphorae and sherds of Roman ware found in significant numbers at Arikamedu in\\nsouth India. Besides, the western traders also brought tin, lead, coral and slave girls.\\n(iii)\\nCrafts and Industries\\nCrafts production started growing in this period with tremendous impetus, as trade and\\ncommerce, both internal and foreign, was dependent to a great extent on the craft activi-\\nties. The text called Milindapanho mentions 75 occupations of which 60 were associated\\nwith crafts. The level of specialization was very high and there were separate artisans\\nworking in gold, silver, precious stones etc. Ujjain was a prominent bead making centre.\\nTextile industry was another prominent industry. Mathura and Vanga (east Bengal) were\\nfamous for variety of cotton and silk textiles. The discovery of some dying vats at some\\nsites in south India indicates that dying was a thriving craft in the area during this period.\\nThe artisans in this period touched new heights of prosperity and there are numerous\\ninscriptions which refer to the donations made by artisans to monasteries.\\n(iv)\\nGuilds\\nThe communities of merchants were organised in groups known as Shreni or guilds under\\nthe head called sreshthi. Another type of mercantile group was called sartha which\\nsignified mobile or caravan trading corporation of interregional traders. The leader of such\\na guild was called sarthavaha. Like merchants almost all craft vocations were also organised\\ninto guilds, each under a headman called Jyestha. These included weavers, corn dealers,\\nbamboo workers, oil manufacturers, potters etc. The guilds were basically associations of\\nmerchants and craftsmen following the same profession or dealing in the same commod-\\nity. They elected their head and framed their own rules regarding prices and quality etc., to\\nregulate their business on the basis of mutual goodwill. They also served as banks and\\nreceived deposits from the public on a fixed rate of interest.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 6.6\\n1.\\nWhat was Uttarapatha?\\n2.\\nWhat was Dakshinapatha?\\n3.\\nWhat was the impact of the discovery of Monsoons on Indian History?\\n4.\\nWhich book gives the best account of Indo-Roman trade?\\n5.\\nWhat were guilds?\\n6.7 ART AND ARCHITECTURE\\nArt in the post-Mauryan period was predominantly religious. Two most important\\nfeatures concerning art and architecture of this period are the construction of stupas\\n91\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\nand development of regional schools of sculpture. Idols of the Buddha were carved\\nout for the first time in this period. On account of contact with the foreigners from\\nnorthwest, a specific school of art called Gandhara School of art developed in this\\nperiod. It was influenced, to a great extent, by the Greek style or art forms.\\n(i)\\nStupas\\nA stupa was a large hemispherical dome with a central chamber in which relics of\\nthe Buddha or some Buddhist monk were kept in a small casket. The base was\\nsurrounded by a path for clockwise circumambulation (pradakshina), enclosed by\\nwooden railings which were later made in stone. Three prominent stupas of this\\nperiod are at Bharhut and Sanchi (both in M.P), which were originally built by Ashoka\\nbut enlarged later, and Amravati and Nagarjunkonda (both in Andhra Pradesh).\\nThe Bharhut stupa in its present form dates to the middle of the second century BC. It\\nis important for its sculptures. Its railings are made of red stone. Three big stupas were\\nconstructed at Sanchi in this period. The biggest of the three, which was built originally\\nby emperor Ashoka, was enlarged to twice its size sometime in the second century BC.\\nA number of stupas were also constructed in south India during this period but none has\\nsurvived in its entirety. The Amravati stupa, situated at Amravati in Andhra Pradesh\\ntook its final shape sometime in the second century AD. The sculptures on stupas are\\ndrawn on the themes based on Jataka and other Buddhist stories.\\nFig. 6.1 Sanchi Stupa\\n92\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n Post Mauryan Developments\\nFig. 6.2 Gandhara Art - Bodhisattva\\n(ii)\\nRock Cut Architecture\\nApart from the stupas, this period also marks a progress in rock cut architecture. A large\\nnumber of temples, halls and places of residence for monks were cut out of the solid rocks\\nnear Pune and Nasik in Maharashtra under the Satavahanas. The place of worship gen-\\nerally had a shrine cell with a votive stupa placed in the centre. This place was known as\\na chaitya and the rock cut structure used as the residence for monks was called a vihara.\\n(iii)\\nSchools of Sculptural Art\\nThe first century witnessed the division of Buddhism in two parts, Hinayana and\\nMahayana. Mahayana Buddhism encouraged Buddha’s worship as a god in human\\nform. As a result a large number of Buddha images were built in different regions.\\nThere were three major schools of sculptural art which developed in this period. These\\nwere: Mathura school of art, Gandhara School of art and Amravati school of art.\\nThe Mathura School: The most prominent contribution of the Mathura school to the\\ncontemporary art was the images of Buddha which were carved for the first time perhaps\\nin this art form. The Mathura artists used local red stone with black spots to make the\\nimages. Mathura has also yielded large numbers of sculptures of Jaina deities besides the\\nayagapatas or stone slabs to place objects of worship. The Brahmanical influence on the\\nart school of Mathura is also evident. During the Kushana period a number of sculptures\\nof brahmanical deities were carved, which included Kartikeya, Vishnu, Kubera.\\n93\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\nThe Gandhara School of Art: The Gandhara region was situated in the northwestern\\npart of the Indian Subcontinent. This region was successively ruled by the Greeks, Mauryas,\\nSungas, Shakas, and Kushanas for many centuries. The school of art which developed\\nhere around the beginning of the Christian era has been called variously as Graeco-Ro-\\nman, Indo Greek or Graeco-Buddhist. This is perhaps because this school has all the\\ninfluences-Roman, Greek and Indian. The theme of sculptures in predominantly Buddhist\\nbut their style is Greek. The chief patrons of Gandhara art were the Shakas and Kushanas.\\nThe stone used for making idols of Buddha and Bodhisattava was predominantly\\nblue-grey schist. Chief characteristics of Gandhara school of art lies in its beautiful\\nportrayal of human figures with distinguished muscles of the body. Buddha is depicted\\nwith a garment draped in Graeco-Roman fashion, and with very curly hair. These\\nbeautiful images of the Buddha are ranked among the best pieces of sculptures.\\nThe Amravati School of Art: The Amravati school of art flourished in the region of\\nAndhra Pradesh between the lower valleys of rivers Krishna and Godavari. The main\\npatrons of this art form were the Satavahans but it carried on even later, patronized by\\ntheir successor Ikshavaku rulers. This art is said to have flourished between 150 BC and\\n350 AD. Sculptures of this school are mainly found on the railings, plinths and other parts\\nof stupas. The thematic representations include the stories from the life of the Buddha.\\n An important characteristic of the Amravati school is the ‘narrative art’. The medal-\\nlions were carved in such a manner that they depict an incident in a natural way. For\\nexample one medallion depicts a whole story of ‘taming of an elephant by the Bud-\\ndha’. Another important feature of Amravati art is the use of white marble like stone\\nto carve out the figures. There is prominence of human figures rather than of nature.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 6.7\\n1.\\nWhat are the two most important features of the post-Mauryan architecture?\\n2.\\nWhat was a stupa?\\n3.\\nWhich were the prominent stupas of the post-Mauryan period?\\n4.\\nDifferentiate between a chaitya and a vihara.\\n5.\\nName the schools of sculptural art that developed in the post-Mauryan period.\\n6.\\nWhat kind of stone was used in the Mathura school?\\n7.\\nWho were the chief patrons of Gandhara school of art?\\n94\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n Post Mauryan Developments\\n6.8 EARLY HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA\\n(i)\\nThe Megalithic Cultures of South India\\nThe neolithic phase of south India, which was highlighted by the use of polished stone\\naxe and blade tools, was succeeded by the Megalithic cultures (1200 BC–300 BC)\\nMegaliths were tomb spots consisting of burials or graves covered with huge (mega)\\nstones. They were, in most cases, located outside the settlement area. These Mega-\\nlith burials have yielded the first iron objects from south India. Besides these the use\\nof Black and Red ware pottery was also a distinctive feature of the Megalithic people.\\nThese Megaliths have been found in large numbers from the Nagpur area in\\nMaharashtra in north to the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula. Prominent sites that\\nhave yielded Megalith graves include Brahmagiri, Maski, (Karnataka). Adichallanur\\n(Tamilnadu) and Junapani near Nagpur (Maharastra).\\nIdentical iron tools have been found universally from all the Megalith graves. These\\ntools which indicate their craft activities and include arrowheads, daggers, swords,\\nspearheads, tridents, battle axe, hoes, ploughshares, sickles etc. These artifacts,\\nalongwith the food grains such as wheat, rice etc., found at various megalithic sites\\nindicate that the megalithic people followed for their livelihood agro-pastoral and hunting\\nactivities. The megalithic period in south India was followed by the Sangam age.\\n(iii)\\nThe Sangam Age\\nThe Sangam age refers to that period in the early history of south India when large\\nnumbers of poems in Tamil were composed by a number of authors. The term Sangam\\nrefers to an assembly or “meeting together” of Tamil poets. Traditionally, three Sangams\\nFig 6.3 Megalithic Graves\\n95\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\nor assemblies are believed to have been convened one after the other. All the three\\nSangams took place at different places under the patronage of the Pandya kings of\\nMadurai. Poems within the Sangam literature were composed on two broader themes\\nof love and war. It was later put together in eight collections called Ettutogai. This\\nliterature is believed to have been composed between 300 BC and 300 AD. A re-\\nmarkable feature of the Sangam literature is its vivid portrayal of the contemporary\\nsociety and culture of Tamilaham, or Tamil region and its peaceful and harmonious\\ninteraction with the northern (Aryan) culture.\\nTamilaham stretches between the hills of Tirupati and the tip of Kanyakumari. It was\\ndivided amongst large number of chieftains and the chieftainship was hereditary. The\\nimportant chieftains who dominated Tamil region during Sangam Age were the Cholas,\\nwith their capital at Uraiyur, the Cheras with their capital at Vanji, (near Karur) and\\nPandyas with their capital at Madurai. The Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras had several\\nDECCAN AND\\nSOUTH INDIA\\n(BC. 300 - AD 750)\\n200\\n0\\n200\\n400\\nKilometers\\nARABIAN\\nSEA\\nBAY OF\\nBENGAL\\nI\\nN\\nD\\nI\\nA\\nN\\nO\\nC\\nE\\nA\\nN\\nModern Town\\nAncient Sites\\nLakshadweep\\n(INDIA)\\nCaveri\\nTu\\nn\\ng\\nb\\nh\\na\\ndr\\na\\nKrishna\\nGodavari\\nM\\na\\nh\\na\\nn\\na\\ndi\\nTa\\np\\nt\\ni\\nN\\nar\\nm\\na\\nd\\na\\nBombay\\nBanavasi\\nEllora\\nAjanta\\nNagpur\\nHyderabad\\nPattadakal\\nGuntur\\nVengi\\nDmara Ni Kota\\nNagarjunakunda\\nMadras\\nKanchi\\nMahabalipuram\\nKaveripattanam\\nUraiyur\\nMadurai\\nI\\nN\\nD\\nI\\nA\\nMap 6.3 India: Tamilnadu and Northern Culture\\n(Chennai)\\n(Mumbai)\\n96\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\n Post Mauryan Developments\\nsubordinate chiefs. Tribute from subordinate chiefs along with plunder, were the main\\nsources of revenue. There was frequent conflicts between the Cheras, Cholas and\\nPandyas. It gave large scope to the Sangam poets to compose poems on war.\\nThe whole Tamilaham in this period was divided into five tinais or eco-zones, i.e.,\\nzones based on their economic resources. These were: kurinji (hilly region); palai\\n(arid zone); mullai (pastoral tracts); marudam (wet lands); and neital (seacoast).\\nThese zones were not clearly demarcated, and were scattered all around the region.\\nBecause of their different geographical contexts and ecological specialties people in\\ndifferent tinais had their own modes of subsistence. For example, in kurinji, it was\\nhunting and gathering; in palai, where people could not produce anything they took to\\nraiding and plundering; in mullai people practiced animal husbandry; in marudam it\\nwas plough agriculture; and in neital people took to fishing and salt making.\\nThough the concept of varna was known, social classes in the Sangam period were\\nnot marked by higher or lower rankings as in north India. For example, Brahmans\\nwere present in the society and they performed vedic ceremonies and sacrifices and\\nalso acted as advisers to the chief but they enjoyed no special privileges. People were\\nknown on the basis of their occupation they followed, such as artisans, salt mer-\\nchants, textile merchants, etc. The rich lived in well decorated brick houses and wore\\ncostly clothes whereas the poor lived in mud huts and had scanty clothes to wear.\\nWar heroes occupied a special position in society, and memorial stones called nadukal\\nor virukkal were raised in honour of those who died in fighting, and they were wor-\\nshipped as godlings. Women in the Sangam period appear to have been educated.\\nThis is testified by many poems contributed by women poets to the Sangam literature.\\nWomen are also described as engaged in various economic activities such as paddy\\nplantation, cattle rearing, basket-making, spinning, etc. However, the cruel practice of\\nSati was also prevalent in Tamil society, and it was known as tippayadal. But it was\\nnot obligatory as there are references to widows present in society. However their\\nposition was miserable as they were prohibited to decorate themselves or participate\\nin any form of amusement.\\nThe people were engaged in various economic activities such as agriculture, crafts and\\ntrade. Paddy was the most important crop. It formed the main part of peoples’ diet and\\nalso served as a medium of barter exchange for inland trade. Since Tamil region does\\nnot have perennial rivers, the chief, wherever possible, encouraged agricultural activi-\\nties by making tanks and dams. The Chola king Karikala of the Sangam age is credited\\nwith constructing a dam on the river Kaveri. It is considered to be the earliest dam in the\\ncountry. Among the crafts, the most important was of spinning and weaving of textiles\\ncotton as well as silk. Salt manufacture was another important activity.\\nThe most important feature of the Sangam economy was flourishing trade with the\\nRoman world. It is confirmed by the recovery of a large number of Roman gold coins\\nin south India. The discovery of monsoons and the use of direct sea route between\\nIndian coasts and the western world, as mentioned earlier, was the main reason for\\nthe growth of this trade. It led to rise of important towns and craft centres in the Tamil\\nregion. Vanji, identified with the present day Karur in Tamil Nadu, was the capital of\\nthe Cheras and also an important centre of trade and craft. Muzris, i.e., Cranganore\\non the south-west coast, was the foremost port of the Cheras. We are told that the\\nRoman ships laden with gold used to come here to take back large amounts of pepper.\\nMadurai, the capital of the Pandyas, is described in the Sangam poems as a large city\\n97\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n  Post Mauryan Developments\\nenclosed by a wall. It was an important centre of fine textile and ivory working.\\nKorkai, in the Tirunnelveli district of Tamil Nadu, was an important Pandya port. It\\nwas famous for its pearls. Uraiyur (Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu), the capital of the\\nCholas, was a grand city with magnificent buildings. Kaveripattinam or Puhar was the\\nmain Chola port. The Sangam poems refer to the busy markets guarded by soldiers.\\nIn the field of religion, Sangam period witnessed a close and peaceful interaction\\nbetween north Indian and south Indian traditions. The Brahmanas who performed\\nreligious ceremonies popularized the worship of Indra, Visnu, Siva etc., in south India.\\nThere are also references to the presence of Buddhists and Jainas in Tamil region.\\nThe local people, particularly those of the hills, worshipped a deity called Murugan,\\nwhich in northern India come to be identified with Kartikeya, a war god.\\nIn short, the Sangm literature through its poems on love and emotion (aham) and\\nwarfare and social behaviour (puram) on the whole present a picture of political\\nconflict, social inequality and economic prosperity of early Tamil region during 300\\nBC–300 AD.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 6.8\\n1.\\nWhat are the Megaliths?\\n2.\\nWhat does the term Sangam refer to?\\n3.\\nWhat are the themes of Sangam literature?\\n4.\\nWhich are the important chieftains mentioned in the Sangam literature?\\n5.\\nWhich are the five tinai or eco-zones noted in the Sangam poems?\\n6.\\nWhich Chola chief built a dam on river Kaveri?\\nWHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT\\nIn the post – Mauryan Period, Shungas succeeded the Mauryas in north India.

Their period was marked by great progress in art, architecture and literature.\\nThey ruled up to circa A.D.550. After their collapse there emerged various regional\\nkingdoms in north India.

His son\\nGhatotkacha, who carried the title of maharaja, appears to be some small king about\\nwhom nothing much is known.\\n(a)\\nChandragupta I\\nThe real founder of the Gupta empire was Chandragupta I (AD 319–334). The year\\nof his accession in A.D. 319 marks the beginning of the Gupta era. It was henceforth\\nused in all their records, and also those of their feudatories. He took the title of\\nmaharajadhiraja (king of kings). He married a Lichchhavi princess Kumaradevi.\\nThis event is recorded in a series of gold coins issued by Chandragupta. It appears\\n102\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Guptas and Their Successors\\nthat this matrimonial alliance gave legitimacy, prestige and strength to the Gupta king.\\nChandragupta, was ruling over Magadha (Bihar) Saket (modern Ayodhya) and Prayaga\\n(modern Allahabad) with his capital at Pataliputra (Modern Patna).\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS  7.1\\n1.\\nWho was the real founder of the Gupta dynasty?\\n2.\\nGive two material advantages that helped the Guptas to establish an empire?\\n3.\\nHow did the marriage alliance with the Lichchhavi’s help Chandragupta?\\n(b) \\nSamudragupta\\nChandragupta was succeeded by his son Samudragupta (A.D. 335–375).\\nSamudragupta followed a policy of conquest and enormously enlarged his kingdom.\\nHis achievements are recorded in a long inscription (prashasti), written in pure San-\\nskrit by his court poet Harisena. The inscription is engraved on a Pillar at Allahabad.\\nIt enumerates the people and the regions conquered by Samudragupta. He adopted a\\ndifferent policy for different area conquered by him.\\nIn the Ganga-Yamuna doab, he followed a policy of annexation. He defeated nine\\nnaga rulers and incorporated their kingdoms in the Gupta empire. He then proceeded\\nto conquer the forest kingdoms of central India, mentioned as atavirajyas. The rulers\\nof these tribal areas were defeated and forced into servitude. This area had a strate-\\ngic value as it contained a route to south India. It enabled Samudragupta to proceed to\\nSouth along the eastern coast conquering twelve kings on the way and reached as far\\nas Kanchi near Chennai. Samudragupta, instead of annexing their kingdoms, liberated\\nand reinstated these kings on their thrones. This policy of political conciliation for\\nsouth India was adopted because he knew that it was difficult to keep them under\\ncontrol and subservience once he returned to his capital in north. So it was enough for\\nhim that these states recognized his suzerainty and paid him tributes and presents.\\nAccording to the Allahabad inscription, neighbouring five frontier kingdoms and nine\\nrepublican states of Punjab and western India were overawed by the conquests of\\nSamudragupta.

He was\\nable to maintain the empire built up by his father but during the later part of his reign\\nthere was a threat from the Hunas of Central Asia. After occupying Bactria the\\nHunas crossed the Hindukush Mountains and entered India. Their first attack during\\nhis reign was repulsed by prince Skandagupta. The Guptas however could not pro-\\ntect their empire for long and the successive waves of Huna invasion made the\\nGupta’s very weak. This was one of the main factors which accelerated the disinte-\\ngration of the Gupta empire.\\nThe inscriptions issued by the Hunas show that by AD 485 they had occupied eastern\\nMalwa and a large part of central India. Punjab and Rajasthan also passed into their\\nhands. The first important ruler of the Hunas in India was Toramana who conquered\\nan area stretching up to Eran near Bhopal in central India. His son Mihirkula suc-\\n105\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Guptas and Their Successors\\nceeded him in AD 515. He is described in texts as a tyrant and an iconoclast. Both\\nYashodharman of Malwa and Narasimhagupta Baladitya of the Gupta dynasty finally\\ndefeated Mihirkula. But this victory over the Hunas could not revive the Gupta Empire.\\nBesides the Huna invasion there was also a gradual decline in economic prosperity. It is\\nindicated by the gold coins of later Gupta rulers, which have less of gold content and more\\nof alloy. We also notice a gradual disappearance of coins in the post Gupta period. It led\\nthe kings to make payments in form of land rather than cash. It is evident by the discovery\\nof large-scale land grant charters donating land to brahmanas and officers.\\nThe practice of giving land for religious and secular purposes in lieu of services ren-\\ndered to the State is normally termed as feudalism. Under this practice, the donee\\n(the one who receives the grant) was given the right not only to collect the taxes but\\nalso to administer the donated land. This created small-small pockets of power trying\\nceaselessly to expand their sphere of influence at the cost of the ruling authority.\\nThe decline of the Gupta empire resulted in the emergence of numerous ruling dynas-\\nties in different parts of northern India. The prominent among them were the\\nPushyabhutis of Thanesar, Maukharies of Kanauj and the Maitrakas of Valabhi. The\\npolitical scene in the Peninsular India was no different.

Dhruvasena II was the most important ruler of the Maitrakas.\\nHe was a contemporary of Harshavardhana and was married to his daughter. Hsuan\\nTsang tells us that Dhruvasena II attended Harsha’s assembly at Prayaga (Allahabad).\\nRuling over Saurashtra in Gujarat, the Maitrakas developed Valabhi as their capital.\\nThis city became an important center of learning.

Maukharies were also the\\nsubordinate rulers of the Guptas and used the title of samanta. Harshavardhana’s\\nsister Rajyashri was married to Grihavarman. Shashanka, the ruler of Bengal (Gaur),\\nand Devgupta, the Later Gupta ruler jointly attacked Grihavarman and killed him. The\\nkingdom of Kanauj was then merged with that of the Pushyabhutis and Harsha shifted\\nhis capital from Thanesar (Kurukshetra) to Kanauj.\\n106\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Guptas and Their Successors\\n7.3 PUSHYABHUTIS OF THANESAR\\nAn important ruling family to gain prominence after the fall of the Gupta was that\\nof the Pushyabhutis who had their capital at Thanesar (Thanesvara in\\nKurukshetra). The dynasty became influential with the accession of\\nPrabhakarvardhana, who was able to defeat the Hunas and strengthen his posi-\\ntion in the regions of Punjab and Haryana. After his death, his elder son\\nRajyavardhana came to the throne but he was treacherously killed by Shashanka,\\nthe king of Bengal and Bihar. Harshavardhana then ascended the throne in AD\\n606. He was only sixteen years of age at that time. Still he proved himself to be\\na great warrior and an able administrator.

Their history can be reconstructed on the basis of a large\\nnumber of land grant charters issued to the brahmanas. Rudrasena II of the royal\\nVakataka family was married to Prabhavatigupta, the daughter of Chandragupta II of\\nthe imperial Gupta family. Culturally the Vakataka kingdom is important because it\\nbecame a channel to spread brohamanical culture to south India.\\n107\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Guptas and Their Successors\\n7.6 CHALUKYAS (SIXTH-EIGHTH CENTURY A.D.)\\nThe Chalukyas played a prominent role in the history of Deccan and south India for\\nabout two hundred years from the beginning of sixth century A.D.

But,\\nthe Gupta administration was decentralized in nature. It means that feudatories i.e. local\\nKings and smaller chiefs ruled a large part of their empire. The pompous titles such as\\nmaharajadhiraja, parambhattaraka, parameshvara etc were adopted by the imperial\\nGuptas. These lesser rulers adorned their names with titles like raja and maharaja.\\nThe kingship was normally hereditary. The king was the focus of administration.\\nPrinces, ministers and advisors assisted him. The princes were also made the vice-\\nroys of the provinces. Provinces were known as desha, rashtra or bhukti and their\\nhead was called uparika. The provinces were divided into a number of districts\\ncalled pradesha or vishaya. The administrative head of the vishaya was known as\\nvishayapati. The vishayas were further divided into villages. The village headman\\ncalled gramadhyaksha looked after the affairs of the village with the help of village\\nelders. The artisans and merchants took an active part in the town administration\\nduring the Gupta period. The Gupta bureaucracy was less elaborate as compared to\\nthat of the Mauryas. The high level central officers under the Guptas were called the\\nkumaramatyas. Important functionaries like mantri, senapati were all recruited from that\\n109\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Guptas and Their Successors\\ncadre. Administrative posts were not only hereditary but often several offices were com-\\nbined in the hands of the same persons as in the case of Harisena, the composer of the\\nAllahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta. He has been described as a\\nmahadandanayaka (chief judicial officer) as well as a mahasandhivigrahika (minister\\nfor war and peace). The ruler himself often appointed high-ranking officers but the heredi-\\ntary nature of the post must have weakened the royal control over the administration.\\nDuring the Gupta period land taxes increased considerably. The land tax called bali\\nvaried from 1/4th to 1/6th of the total produce. Two new agricultural taxes that appear\\nin Gupta inscriptions are uparikara and udranga. However, their exact nature is not\\nclear. In addition, the peasants had to meet the demands of the feudatories. They also\\nhad to feed the royal army when it passed from the villages. The villagers were also\\nsubjected to forced labour (vishti).\\nThe judicial system was far more developed under the Gupta rulers than in earlier\\ntimes. For the first time civil and criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Disputes\\nconnected with various type of property were considered in civil law. Elaborate laws\\nwere laid down about inheritance. Theft and adultery fell under criminal law. The king\\nupheld the law and tried cases with the help of the brahmanas. The guilds of mer-\\nchants and artisans were governed by their own laws.\\nHarsha governed his empire on the same lines, as did the Guptas. But during his period the\\nadministration became more decentralized and the number of feudatories grew further. In\\nHarsha’s time the officers and the religious persons were paid mainly in land. It encour-\\naged the system of feudalism which grew much more in the post- Harsha period.\\nIn the empire of Harsha law and order does not appear to be so well maintained.\\nHsuan Tsang was twice robbed of all his belongings during his travels in India.

The\\nsupremacy of the brahmanas was increasing. They were getting large-scale land\\ngrants not only from the rulers but from other people also. The land was given along\\nwith administrative rights and tax exemptions. Thus, a new class of brahmana land-\\nlords was created. Supported by the king, they tended to exploit the peasants.\\nWe also notice a proliferation of castes in this period. With the extension of brahmanical\\nculture in distant and different areas, a large number of tribals were assimilated in the\\nbrahmanical social structure of varna system fold, as were some foreigners such as\\nthe Hunas. While the foreigners and tribals heads were included as kshtriyas, the\\nordinary tribals were given the status of shudras.\\nThe position of shudras however improved somewhat during this period. They were\\nallowed to listen to the epics and the puranas. They could also perform some domestic\\nrituals that were earlier prohibited for them. In the seventh century Hsuan Tsang calls\\nshudras as agriculturists and the vaishyas as traders. A distinction was also made be-\\ntween shudras and untouchables, the latter being treated lower in status than the shudras.\\nThe untouchables are referred to as chandalas. They lived outside the village and dealt\\nin unclean jobs such as scavenging or butchery. The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien tells us\\nthat whenever they entered the towns or market places they would strike a piece of\\nwood to announce their arrival, so that the others might not touch them and get polluted.\\nReferences to slaves are found in the contemporary Dharmashastras (Law Books).\\nNarada mentions fifteen types of slaves. They were mainly domestic servants em-\\nployed in cleaning and sweeping. The prisoners of war, debt bondsmen, born of a\\nslave woman were all considered slaves.\\nThe status of women continued to decline in Gupta period. The main reason for the\\nsubordination of women was their complete dependence on men for their livelihood.\\nThe women were not entitled to inherit property. However, she had full right on her\\nstridhana i.e. the presents received by the bride at the time of her marriage. The free\\nrepresentation of females in art suggest that there was no purdah system in the\\nsociety. However, there is evidence of the presence of sati system. The first evi-\\ndence of sati (immolation of widow) is found in an inscription (AD 510) at Eran in\\nMadhya Pradesh. In the Harshacarita of Bana, the queen performs sati on the\\ndeath of her husband king Prabhakaravardhana. Even Rajyashri, sister of Harsha\\nwas about to perform sati when Harsha rescued her.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 7.9\\n1.\\nWhat are shudras described as by Hsuan Tsang?\\n2.\\nWhat is stridhana?\\n3.\\nWhere do we find the first epigraphical evidence to ‘Sati’?\\n111\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Guptas and Their Successors\\n7.10 ECONOMY\\nThe period from circa fourth century to eighth century was a period of great agricul-\\ntural expansion. The vast areas of land were brought under cultivation and improve-\\nments were made in the existing methods of production to attain higher yield. One of\\nthe reasons for it was the practice of granting lands to brahmanas and secular offic-\\ners in different areas. It helped in bringing virgin land under the plough. The spread of\\nknowledge regarding the use of iron plough share, manure, irrigation and preservation\\nof cattle wealth in backward areas also contributed to rural prosperity. It however\\nbrought no relief to peasants who continued to suffer tremendous tax burden.\\nThe Gupta and post- Gupta period witnessed a comparative decline in country’s trade\\nand commerce. Till AD 550 India continued to have some trade with the eastern\\nRoman empire to which it exported silk, and spices. Around the sixth century the\\nRomans learnt the art of rearing silk worms. This adversely affected India’s foreign\\ntrade in this precious commodity. The disruption of north-western route by the Hunas\\nwas another factor for this decline. India tried to make up the loss by carrying on\\ntrade with south-east Asian countries but it did not help revive the economy substan-\\ntially. The loss in trade lessened the inflow of gold and silver into the country. It is\\nconfirmed by a general scarcity of gold coins after the Guptas.\\nThe Guptas did issue a large number of gold coins called dinaras. But we notice that\\nthe gold coins of each successive Gupta ruler, after Chandragupta II, contain less of\\ngold and more of alloy. After the Guptas very few coins of Kings of different dynas-\\nties have been found. Thus in the absence of coinage we can presume that a self-\\nsufficient economic system with limited trade prevailed after the downfall of the Guptas.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 7.10\\n1.\\nName the commodities exported by the Indians to the eastern Roman empire?\\n2.\\nWhat were the Gupta gold coins known as?\\n7.11 LITERATURE\\nThe Gupta period is considered as the Golden Age of art and literature.\\nA huge body of religious and secular literature was compiled in this period. The two\\ngreat epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were finally completed in the fourth\\ncentury. The stories of both the epics symbolize the victory of good over evil. Both\\nRama and Krishna came to be considered incarnation of Vishnu.\\nThe Gupta period marks the beginning of the writing of the literature known as Puranas.\\nThese texts refer to the stories about the Hindu gods and mention the ways to please\\nthem through fasts and pilgrimages. The major Puranas written in this period are the\\nVishnu Purana, Vayu Purana and the Matsya Purana. For the worship of\\nShiva, Shiv Purana was written whereas the various incarnations of Vishnu are\\nglorified in Varaha Purana, Vamana Purana, and Narasimha Purana. They were\\nmeant for the worship by common man. Some Smritis or the law books were also\\ncompiled in the Gupta period. One of these, the Narada Smriti throws light on the\\ngeneral social and economic rules and regulations of the period.\\n112\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nThe Guptas and Their Successors\\nThe literature in Gupta period was written in Sanskrit. The greatest of all the poets was\\nKalidasa who lived in the court of Chandragupta II in the fifth century AD. His works are\\nvery famous and have been translated in many European languages. Some of the works\\nthat he authored are Meghadutam, Abhijnanashakuntalam, Raghuvamsha,\\nKumarasambhava and Ritusamhara. The notable feature of his works is that the charac-\\nters of higher caste speak in Sanskrit while those of lower caste and women speak in\\nPrakrit. The other famous dramatists to have flourished in this period are Shudraka, writer\\nof Mrichchhkatikam and Vishakhadatta who authored Mudrarakshasa.\\nIn the seventh century Banabhatta, the court poet of Harsha, wrote Harshacarita\\npraising his patron. Written in an ornate style, it became a model for later writers. The\\nearly history of Harsha is reconstructed on the basis of this text. Another text written\\nby him is Kadambari. Harsha too was considered to be a literary monarch. He is said\\nto have authored three plays: Priyadarshika, Nagananda and Ratnavali.\\nIn south India, the period from AD 550–750 witnessed the growth of Bhakti literature\\nin Tamil. Songs were composed by the Vaishnava saints (Alvars) and Saiva saints\\n(Nayannaras) in praise of their respective gods. One of the most famous of the Alvar\\nsaints was a woman called Andal.

As in earlier times, Buddhism gave a\\ngreat impetus to art in Gupta period also. A life size image of Buddha made in copper is\\nfound from Sultanganj in Bihar. Beautiful images of Buddha were also created at Mathura\\nand Sarnath. The finest examples of Buddhist art during Gupta period are the paintings\\nof Ajanta caves. Depicting the life of Buddha and the Jataka stories, these paintings\\nwith lustrous colors have not faded even after fourteen centuries. The Ajanta caves are\\nnow included in the list of the World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO.\\nIt is for the first time in the Gupta period that the temples in the form of structures\\nwere constructed in north India. These temples were made in the architectural style\\nknown as Nagara. Two of these temples, one made of bricks at Bhitargaon in Kanpur\\nand the other of stone at Deogarh in Jhansi have been found in Uttar Pradesh. Here\\nthe images of Vishnu are placed in the center as a chief deity.\\nThe Gupta coins are also pieces of art. They are well designed and meticulously\\ncrafted.

But they were tolerant to other\\nreligions too. The Chinese pilgrims Fa Hien and Hsuan Tsang, who came to India\\nduring the reign of Chandragupta II and Harsha respectively, clearly give the impres-\\nsion that Buddhism was also flourishing. Harsha, though a Shaiva in his early life,\\nbecame a follower of Buddhism and a great patron of the religion. He convened an\\nassembly at Kanauj to publicize Mahayanaism. Nalanda developed as a great center\\nof education for Mahayana Buddhism during his time. Students from outside coun-\\ntries also came to study in this university. According to Hsuan Tsang the revenues of\\none hundred villages supported it.\\nBhagvatism centered on the worship of Vishnu and his incarnations. It put emphasis\\non bhakti (loving devotion) and ahimsa (non killing of animals) rather than Vedic\\nrituals and sacrifices. The new religion was quite liberal, and assimilated the lower\\nclasses in its fold. According to Bhagavadgita, the chief text of Bhagvatism, when-\\never there was a social crisis Vishnu would appear in a human form and save the\\npeople. Thus ten incarnations of Vishnu were perceived. Puranas were written to\\npopularize the virtues of each one of these incarnations. The idols of gods were\\nhoused in the temples constructed in Gupta period.\\nIn south India, from the seventh century onwards the Tamil saints called Alvars and\\nNayannaras popularized the concept of bhakti. Alvar saints popularized the wor-\\nship of Vishnu and the Nayannar saints, the worship of Shiva.\\nWe also notice the spread of Tantrism in India in this period. From the fifth century\\nthe brahmanas had started receiving land in the tribal areas of Nepal, Assam, Bengal,\\nOrissa, central India and Deccan. As a consequence, the tribal elements came to be\\nassimilated in the brahmanical society. The brahmanas adopted their rituals, gods and\\n115\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n The Guptas and Their Successors\\ngoddesses. It is this assimilation of brahmanical religion and tribal practices which resulted in\\nthe development of Tantrism. It did not believe in any caste or gender bias and admitted both\\nwomen and shudras in its ranks. It put emphasis on ‘female’ as a source of power and\\nenergy. The Tantrik concepts affected, Shaivism and Vaishnavism as well as Buddhism and\\nJainism.

The most\\nnotable among them is an astronomical text called Aryabhatiyam, written by\\nAryabhatta in the fifth century. Aryabhatta was an astronomer and a mathema-\\ntician. He for the first time suggested that the earth rotates on its axis, and re-\\nvolves around the sun and causes eclipse. He was the first to invent “zero” and\\nthe use of the decimal system. Another scholar Varahamihira (end of sixth cen-\\ntury) was a great astronomer who has written a number of books on astronomy.\\nHis work Panchasiddhantika deals with five astronomical systems. Brahmagupta\\na well known mathematician also lived in the Gupta period.\\nMetallurgy also saw technological advancement in Gupta times. The bronze images of\\nBuddha produced on a considerable scale in the period are an example of advanced\\ntechnology.

Guptas were able to establish a vast empire as\\nthey could exploit the iron ores of central India and Bihar and also this being very fertile\\nland. He was succeeded by Samudrgupta (AD 335–375) and Chandra Gupta II (AD\\n375 – 414). Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Fa Hien (AD 404–411) visited India and has left\\nan vivid account of people of that period. Great Sanskrit poet and playwright Kalidasa\\nwas one of the nine luminaries of Chandra gupta II. Hunas from Central Asia threat-\\nened the Gupta empire & its invasion made Gupta’s very weak. Subsequently decline\\nin economic prosperity led to gradual decline of Gupta’s empire.\\nHarshavardhana (606–647), a great warrior and able administrator established kingdom in\\nnorth whose account is available in Harishcharita by his court poet Banabhatta. Chinese\\nBuddhist pilgraim Hsuan Tsang visited India during his time. Harsha was defeated by Pula\\nKesin II Chalukya ruler of south, so river Namada become Harsha’s Southern boundary.\\nPallavas rose to power in pennisular India. Tamil bhakti literature and Dravidian style\\nof art and architecture in South India developed during this period.\\nSociety underwent a change during Gupta’s period. Brahmaincal culture extended to\\ndistant and different areas. A large number of tribals were assimilated in the varna\\nsystem and some foreigners like Hunas were also stratified into Brahmanical system.\\nThe status of women declined further in this period.\\nGupta period is Golden age of Art and literature Ramayana and Mahabharata were\\ncompleted in 4th century.

It was earlier treated by historians as a ‘dark phase’. It was so\\nbecause during this time the whole country was divided into  numerous regional\\nstates which were busy fighting with each other. But recent studies have indicated\\nthat, though politically divided, India witnessed a growth of new and rich cultural\\nactivities in the fields of art, literature and language. In fact, some best specimens of\\ntemple architecture and Indian literature belong to this period. Thus, far from being\\n‘dark’ it may be treated as a bright and vibrant phase of Indian history.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nidentify the various regional kingdoms which emerged during AD 750 and AD\\n1200;\\n \\nexamine the nature of state;\\n \\nhighlight the  social  and economic changes;\\n \\nevaluate the cultural activities;\\n \\nand assess the significance of India’s contact with Southeast Asia during 8th and\\n12th centuries;\\n8.1 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\\nThe political developments after Harshavardhan, about whom you have read in the\\nlast chapter, can be best understood if we divide the period from AD 750 to AD 1200\\nin two parts (a) AD 750–AD 1000; (b) AD 1000–AD 1200. The first phase was\\nmarked by the growth of three important political powers in India. These were Gurjara\\nPratiharas in north India, Palas in eastern India and Rashtrakutas in South India.\\nThese powers were constantly fighting with each other with a aim to set up their\\ncontrol on Gangetic region in northern India. This armed conflict among these three\\npowers is known as ‘Tripartite struggle’. In the second phase we notice the break up\\nof these powers. It resulted in the rise of many smaller kingdoms all over the country.\\nFor example, in northern India, the disintegration of the Pratihara empire brought to\\nthe forefront various Rajput states under the control of different Rajput dynasties\\nsuch as the Chahmanas (Chauhans), Chandellas, Paramaras. etc. These were the\\n121\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n India Between AD 750–1200\\nstates which fought and resisted the Turkish attacks from northwest India led by\\nMahmud Ghaznavi and Mohammad Ghori in the 11th and 12th centuries, but had to\\nyield ultimately as they failed to stand unitedly  against the invaders.\\nLet us now trace briefly the history of the three powers we have mentioned above.\\nThe Gurjara Pratihara dynasty was founded by Nagabhatta I in the region of Malwa\\nin the eighth century. He belonged to a Rajput clan.Later one of his successors,\\nVatsaraja extended his rule over to a large part of North India and made Kannauj in\\nwestern Uttara Pradesh his capital. Vatsaraja’s policy of expansion brought him in\\nconflict with Dharamapala, the Pala King of Bengal and Bihar. Soon, the Rashtrakuta\\nking Dhruva from south India jumped into the fight. And thus began what is known as\\n‘Tripartite Struggle’ i.e struggle among three powers. It continued for about  the next\\nhundred  and fifty years under various succeeding kings with ups and downs. The\\nGurjara-Pratiharas, however, could continue to maintain their hold over Kannauj  till\\nthe last. One of the important kings of this dynasty was Mihira Bhoja (ninth century).\\nMap 8.1 Political Map of India (750–1000 AD)\\n122\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nIndia Between AD 750–1200\\nHe was highly praised by an Arabian scholar Sulaiman for keeping his empire safe\\nfrom robbers.\\nIn eastern India, Pala dynasty was founded by Gopala (8th century). As the names of\\nall the succeeding kings ended with ‘Pala’ this dynasty come to be known as the\\n‘Pala’ dynasty.The son and grandson of Gopala,viz; Dharmapala and Devapala greatly\\nextended the power and prestige of the Pala dynasty. Though their expansion towards\\nwest was checked by the Pratiharas, the Palas continued to rule over Bihar and Bengal\\nfor nearly four centuries with a small break. The Pala kings were the followers of\\nBuddhism. They  greatly promoted this religion by making monasteries (viharas) and\\ntemples in eastern India. Dharmapala is known to have founded the famous Vikramashila\\nuniversity near Bhagalpur in Bihar. Like Nalanda university, it attracted students from\\nall parts of India and also from Tibet. Many Sanskrit texts were translated into Tibetan\\nat this monastery. The most celebrated name associated with Vikramashila University\\nwas that of Atisha Dipankara who was greatly respected in Tibet.\\nIn south, Dantidurga was the founder of the dynasty called, Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th\\nAD). The capital of the Rastrakutas was Manyakheta or Malkhed near Sholapur. It\\nwas under the king Dhruva that the Rashtrakutas turned towards north India in a bid\\nto control Kannauj, then the imperial city. And as mentioned above, it led to the begin-\\nning of ‘Tripartite struggle’. One of the important kings of the Rashtrakuta dynasty\\nwas Krishna I. He built the famous Kailasha temple at Ellora (near Aurangabad,\\nMaharastra). It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is monolithic i.e. made of one single\\npiece of rock. The Arab accounts inform us that the Rashtrakutas were quite friendly\\nwith the Arab traders who visited their empire. These traders were allowed to build\\nmosques and follow their religion without any hindrance. It testifies to the liberal\\nattitude of the Rashtrakuta kings and also to their desire to draw economic benefit\\nfrom the growing  sea trade conducted by the Arabs at that time.\\nIn South India, the Chola Kings founded a mighty empire during AD 1000–AD 1200.\\nThe relationship  between these Cholas, called the “Imperial Cholas” with the earlier\\nCholas mentioned in the Sangam literature is not clear. The Cholas came to power\\nafter over throwing the authority of the Pallavas in South India. The founder of the\\nChola dynasty was Vijayalaya  (9th century AD)  but the real architects of the glory of\\nthe dynasty were Rajaraja I (AD 985–AD 1014) and his son Rajendra I\\n(AD 1014–AD 1044). During  the heyday of the Chola empire, it extended from\\nR.Tungabhadra (a tributary of R.Krishna) in north to Kanya Kumari in south. The\\nChola Kings made a successful use of their navy and conquered not only Maldive and\\nLakshdweep  Islands but also Sri Lanka. They also defeated the kings of Malaya and\\nJava and Sumatra. One of the greatest contribution of Rajaraja I was the construction\\nof the famous temple known as Rajarajeshwara or Brihadesvara temple, dedicated to\\nShiva at Tanjore. He also ordered a survey of land for better collection of land rev-\\nenue in his empire. The rule of his son, Rajendra I was even more dazzling. He\\ncarried his arms up to Ganga in Bengal after defeating  the Pala King, Mahipala. To\\ncommemorate this victory he founded a new capital called ‘Gangaikondacholapuram’\\nand acquired for himself the title “Gangai-konda” (conqueror of Ganga). He was a\\ngreat patron of learning  and was known as Pandita-chola. The last important Chola\\nking was Kullotunga (AD 1070–1122 AD). Under him the Chola empire started dis-\\nintegrating and shrunk to much smaller area.\\nThe above account will make you understand that though there were frequent inter\\nregional clashes, cultural growth was also taking place side by side. In fact, the emer-\\n123\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n India Between AD 750–1200\\ngence of big political powers brought about a relative stability in different regions. It\\nled to the developments of distinct cultural patterns related to art, architecture and literature\\nwithin each of these regions. We shall discuss these patterns slightly later in this lesson.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 8.1\\n1.\\nName the three dynasties which participated in the Tripartite Struggle’.

What is ‘decentralized’ polity? It is a system in which there is of course a king as\\nthe main authority at the top, but he shares his rule with other small chiefs called feudatories\\nor the samantas. You may wonder who these samantas were. Well  the term ‘Samanta’\\nbasically refers to a king who has been defeated but his kingdom has been restored to him\\nbut with the condition that he will continue to accept the over lordship of the conquering\\nking and also pay regular tribute to him in cash or kind. He may also be asked to help with\\nmilitary assistance in times of need. As these chiefs enjoyed freedom of administra-\\ntion over their regions they were quite powerful. Surely you can guess that these\\nchiefs could always be a threat to the overlord, and no wonder whenever there was\\na weak king at the top, they would assert their independence leading to the break up\\nof the empire. And precisely it was what happened during the last days of Pratihara\\nempire as mentioned above.\\nAnother aspect the decentralized polity was characterized by the practice of making\\nland grants to Brahmanas and others. This practice  was initiated by the Satavahanas\\nkings in the Ist and 2nd centuries AD, but after the Gupta period it had become a\\nnormal practice all over the country. Now land grants came to made not only to\\nreligious persons and institutions but to state officials as well.Why did it so happen? It\\nis suggested that one of the reasons for the increase in land grants during this period,\\nwas the decline in trade and, therefore the shortage of coined  money to pay to the\\nofficials and others for their services. The shortage of coined money in the post-\\nGupta period is indicated by the absence of the presence of coins in the archeological\\nfinds. The land granted to the donee (the receiver of grant) was tax free, i.e., the\\ndonee did not pay any tax to the state and used the produce and income on it for his\\npersonal benefit. The donee was also free from any interference by his king or his\\nofficials in managing the land donoted to him. Thus , these donees converted the\\nlands granted to  them into independent islands of authority with no or little central\\ncontrol.\\nIn the Chola kingdom in South India,the structure of administration was slightly dif-\\nferent. Here at the village level, a great amount of autonomy was enjoyed by the\\nlocal people. They looked after their administration with the help of self elected local\\nbodies. Two types of village assemblies are mentioned in the records. These were\\nknown as Sabha and Ur. Sabha was the assembly in the villages which were inhab-\\nited predominantly by the brahmanas, whereas Ur was in the non brahmanical settle-\\nments. These assemblies looked after the local public works, tax collection, temple\\nmanagement etc., with the help of the members elected through a procedure set  by\\nthe villagers. It was a unique feature of the Chola administration as it represented a\\nharmonious balance between the central authority and the local self-government.\\n125\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n India Between AD 750–1200\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS  8.2\\n1.\\nWhat do you understand by a decentralized political system?

What were the\\nvillage assemblies called?\\n8.3 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES\\nThe early medieval period was also marked by many social and economic changes.\\nSocially, an important phenomenon of this period was the proliferation or increase in\\nMap 8.3 Map of South East Asia\\n126\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nIndia Between AD 750–1200\\nthe number of castes. How did it happen? One of the reason for it was the inclusion of\\nnewer groups into brahmanical society. It is suggested that as the number of land grants\\nincreased, new areas were brought under cultivation. It made local tribal people leave\\nhunting as their main profession and take up  agriculture. They were then transformed\\ninto peasants, and assimilated in society as sudras. The land grants in fact resulted in\\nmovement and migration of Brahmanas to different internal areas where they were\\nable to introduce  and enforce their brahmanical social values. The land grants also led\\nto the increase in the number of Kayastha class. The Kayasthas were basically scribes\\nand they specialized in drafting and writing land grant documents. Naturally, with in-\\ncrease in the number of land grants their importance also increased .\\nBut the most important feature of this period was the rise of  a new class of people\\ncalled the Rajputs, such as Chahmanas, Paramaras, Pratiharas, Chandellas etc. Some\\nhistorians believe that they were the descendants of various groups of foreign invaders\\nsuch as Sakas, Kushanas, Hunas etc, who had been coming to India from northwest\\nduring different times of history. These people gradually settled down in the region of\\nRajasthan and, after intermingling with the Indian society, emerged  as a warrior class.\\nThere are others who treat them as a part of the Kshatriya varna of the brahmanical\\nsystem.But today many scholars see a connection between the rise of Rajput class and\\nthe extension of agriculture activities in Rajasthan. It is pointed out that with the spread\\nof land grants there was an increase in the number of agriculture settlements. As a\\nresult, many local chiefs came to acquire enough financial and political power to set up\\nan independent authority. In order to acquire legitimacy and authencity to  their newly\\nacquired position in the eyes  of their subjects, they invited brahmanas from Gangetic\\nand other regions to perform for them royal rituals and ceremonies, and in return gave\\nthem land and other things as fee,i.e dakshina. They also made brahmanas write about\\ntheir illustrious ancestory linking them with lord Rama (of the solar race) and lord\\nKrishna (of the lunar race) to claim a dignified position of a warrior class.\\nEconomically, the first phase, i.e, AD 750–AD 1000, is believed to be one of decline. It is\\nevident from the absence of coins for exchange and the decayed condition of towns in\\nnorthern India. But in the second phase after AD 1000, we notice a revival of trade\\nactivities. Not only do  we come across new gold coins, there are also numerous refer-\\nences to trade goods and towns. What could be the reason for it? There seem to be two\\nmain reasons for it. One, there was increase in agricultural activities on account of land\\ngrants in fresh areas. It led to surplus production of goods for exchange. And second, the\\nArab traders had emerged on the coastal areas of India as important players in interna-\\ntional sea trade. The Arabs had acquired a foothold in Sind in AD 712 and later, gradually,\\nthey set up their settlements all along the sea from Arabia to China. These settlements\\nserved as important channels for the sale and purchase of Indian goods, and thus helped\\nin the growth of Indian external trade. In south India, the Chola kings maintained close\\ncommercial contact with southeast Asia (Malaya, Indonesia etc) and China.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 8.3\\n1.\\nWhat was the main factor for the growth of Rajput class.\\n127\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n India Between AD 750–1200\\n8.4 CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS\\nThe new regional kingdoms led to the emergence of new regional cultural zones such as\\nBengal and Orissa in the North Gujarat and Maharashtra in Central India  as well as\\nAndhra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu in the South. The various art forms, languages, litera-\\nture, etc. that form an important part of our regional cultures today, took their  shape\\naround this period. Most of the languages such as Bengali, Assamese Oriya, Marathi, etc.\\nthat are spoken in the northern, central and eastern parts of India are some examples. The\\nrich literature produced in these languages began to replace the earlier monopoly of San-\\nskrit literature. The literary works in the regional languages were often composed under\\nthe patronage of the new regional rulers. A famous work composed in the regional lan-\\nguage around this time under the Cholas was the Tamil version of the Ramayana, com-\\nposed by Kamban. Similarly in Karnataka, Pampa who is regarded as one of the jewels of\\nKanada literature composed Vikramarjuna-vijaya, known popularly as Pampa Bharat,\\nin Kannada. In Andhra region, Nanniah translated some portions of Mahabharata in Telugu.\\nIt was later completed by poet Tikkanna in the thirteenth centrury.\\nHowever, Sanskrit still retained a position of importance among the elites as a language of\\nlearning. Important works composed in Sanskrit around this period were the\\nkathasaritasagara a collection of stories, the Rajtarangini, a vivid account of the kings\\nof Kashmir composed by Kalhana and the Gita Govinda, a piece of devotional literature\\nFig 8.1 Nataraja\\n128\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nIndia Between AD 750–1200\\ncomposed on the theme of love between Radha and Krishna, by Jayadeva in Bengal\\nunder the Pala kings.\\nAnother activity that received royal patronage was that of temple –building. The\\ntemples served as representative of the might and glory of the kings who had them\\nbuilt. The loftier the temple, the greater was the might reflected. Indeed there was a\\ndefinite correlation. The construction of large temples and their regular maintenance\\nrequired the mobilization of huge amount of resources, both financial and human. This\\ncould be possible only when the particular king was wealthy & powerful enough.\\nThe three types of temple architecture which evolved during the period are known as\\nthe Nagara, Dravida and Vesara (mixed) styles during this period. The characterstic\\nfeature of the Nagara style of temples was the lofty tower or spire called the Shikhara.\\nTemples built in this style were spread over large parts of northern India, particularly\\nin Central India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Orissa. However,even within the general\\nNagara style, there were distinctive regional characteristics. Some of the outstanding\\nexamples of this style, are the Lingaraja temple at Bhuvaneshwar, the Sun temple at\\nKonark and the Kandariya Mahadeva temple, built by the Chandella kings at Khajuraho.\\nThe Dravida style of architecture is found in South India. It reached the height of its\\nglory under the rule of the Chola kings. Some of the important characteristics of this\\nstyle are the garbhagriha, the vimanas, the mandapa and the gopurams. The\\ngarbhagriha was the inner sanctum that housed the chief-deity to whom the temple\\nwas dedicated. The vimanas were the various storeys built atop the garbhagriha. The\\nmandapa was a hall with numerous carved pillars, placed before the garbhagriha.\\nThe gopurams were the lofty gates along the high walls that enclosed the entire\\ntemple complex. An important example of this style is the Brihadishvara temple built\\nby Chola king Rajaraja at Tanjore. The Vesara temples represented a mixed style.\\nThese were mostly built under the patronage of the Chalukyas and are found at\\nPattadakal near Badami (Karnataka). There was also great improvement in the art of\\nmaking sculptures in this period An important contribution of Chola artists in this\\nrespect was the bronze images of Nataraja. These images represent Siva in his cos-\\nmic dance and are unmatched in their rythem and balance.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 8.4\\n1.\\nWhat was the style of architecture followed in Northern India?\\n2.\\nWhat is the most important contribution of Cholas to the art of Sculpture.\\n8.5 CONTACT  WITH  SOUTHEAST  ASIA\\nIndians were never such people to stay at home. They have been moving out from\\nancient time to different parts of the world for trade and other activities. As far as the\\nIndian contact with Southeast Asia is concerned, it appears to be as old as fifth cen-\\ntury B.C. Jatakas the Buddhist texts belonging to this period refer to Indians visiting\\nSuvarnadvipa (island of gold), which is identified with Java. Such early contacts with\\nSoutheast Asia are confirmed by the recent archeological finds of pearls and orna-\\nments of agate and carnelian, the semi-precious stones of Indian origin,from the coastral\\nsites in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. These finds belong to as far back as first\\n129\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n India Between AD 750–1200\\ncentury BC. According to the Chinese traditions, the first kingdom in South east Asia was\\nfounded at Funan (Cambodia) in the fourth century AD by a brahman known as Kaundinya\\nwho had come from India and had married the local princess. However, Indian and South-\\neast Asian contacts became closer from 5th century AD onwards when inscriptions in\\nSanskrit language start appearing in many areas. It reached its peak during AD 800–AD\\n1300 when many kings and dynasties with Indian names emerge all over Southeast Asia.\\nThe Southeast contact was largely on account of trade. Southeast Asia is rich in\\ncardamom, sandal wood, camphor, cloves etc. which formed important items of trade\\nbetween India and the West. Initially, the Indian traders appear to have settled along\\nthe coast, but gradually they shifted their network to the interior. Along with the trad-\\ners came the priests particularly the Buddhist and brahmanas, to meet the ritual re-\\nquirements of the Indian settlers. It thus created a situation for the spread of Indian social\\nand cultural ideas in South east Asia. But it must be noted that Indian contact did not uproot\\nthe local culture. It was rather a case of peaceful intermixing of Indian concepts with local\\ncultural features. Therefore, for example, while Sanskrit was accepted as a language of\\ncourt and religion in Southeast Asia the regional languages continued to be used side by\\nside , and we find many inscriptions in mixed Sanskrit and local language. Similarly, the\\nconcept of varna was known to the south east Asians and brahmanas were respected in\\nsociety, but social divisions were not rigid as it was in India.\\nThe most important empire which come to be founded in South east Asia in the\\n8th Century AD was the Shailendra empire. It comprised Java, Sumatra,Malay-\\nPennisula and other parts of the Southeast Asian region. They were a leading naval\\npower and on account of their geographical position controlled the trade between\\nChina and India as well as other countries in the west. The Shailendra kings were\\nfollowers of Buddhism and had close contact with the Indian rulers. One of the kings\\nof this empire, built a monastery at Nalanda in the ninth century, and at his request the\\nPala king Devapala of Bengal granted five villages for its upkeep. Similarly in the\\neleventh century another king was permitted by the Chola king Rajaraja I to build a\\nBuddhist monastery at Nagapattam on the Tamil Coast . The Shailendras also built a\\nbeautiful temple dedicated to Buddha at Barabudur in Java. It is situated on the top of\\na hillock and consists of nine gradually receding terraces.\\nBesides Buddhism, the worship of Hindu gods such as Vishnu and Siva was also quite\\npopular in southeast Asia. The temples dedicated to them have been found at various\\nplaces. They show distinct traces of Indian influence and inspiration. One of the most\\nfamous temples, dedicated to Vishnu, is Angkorvat temple built in the 12th century by\\nSurya Varman II, the king of Kambuja (Cambodia).

These\\nrulers were of Turkish and Afghan origin. They established their rule in India after\\ndefeating the Indian ruling dynasties which were mainly Rajputs in northern India.\\nThe main ruler who was overthrown by the invading Turk Muhammad Ghori from\\nDelhi was Prithvi Raj Chauhan. These Sultans ruled for more than 300 years (from\\naround AD 1200 to AD 1526). The last of the Delhi Sultan, Ibrahim Lodi was de-\\nfeated by the Mughals under the leadership of Babur in AD1526 who established the\\nMughal Empire in India.\\nDuring this period of around three hundred years five different dynasties ruled Delhi.\\nThese were the Mamluks (AD 1206–AD 1290) (popularly known as slave dynasty),\\nthe Khaljis (AD 1290–AD 1320), the Tughlaqs (AD 1320–AD 1412), the Sayyids\\n(AD 1412–AD 1451) and the Lodis (AD 1451– AD 1526).

This Arab\\ninvasion in AD 712 was led by Muhammad Bin Qasim a general of the Umayyad caliph-\\nate. Invasion on India was part of the policy of Arab expansion during this period.\\nThe rise of Islam in Arabia (see box) gave rise to a new political system. The process\\nof expansion which had started after the capture of Mecca by the prophet Muhammad\\ncontinued after his death.\\nRise And Spread Of Islam\\nIn the 7thCentury AD, a new religion named “ISLAM” was born in Arabia and in\\na very short span it carved out an empire extending from North Africa to Iberian\\nPeninsula to Iran and India. Islam was founded and preached by Prophet\\nMuhammad (AD 570–632). This religion transformed the religious, political and\\nsocial life of not only the people of Arabia but also of many parts of the world.\\nIslam laid emphasis upon belief in one God and its holy book as the “QURAN”.\\nMuslims believe that the Quran is revealed by God to Prophet Muhammad. Quran\\nis respected as the supreme source of authority in Islam. Every Muslim was asked\\nto pray five times a day, to fast during the month of Ramzan, to distribute alms and\\nto make a pilgrimage, if possible, to Mecca. After the death of Prophet (AD 632)\\nthe task of providing religious and political leadership to the Muslims passed on to\\nthe Caliphs. (Caliph is derived from the Arabic word ‘Khalifa’ which means\\n‘deputy’. This is a title given to the rulers who succeeded Prophet Muhammad).\\nBetween AD 632–661 there were four pious Caliphs, all close companions of the\\nProphet. The Umayyad Caliphate (AD 661–750) succeeded the pious Caliphs.\\nUmayyad dynasty gave stability and prosperity to the Caliphate. Umayyad dy-\\nnasty was followed by the Abbasid Caliphate (AD 750–1258). During the time of\\nlater Abbasids, the Caliphs began to loose political control and independent Muslim\\nRulers (Sultans) emerged in several regions.\\nThe Arab expansion was notable for the speed with which it was accomplished. Between\\nAD 633–637, Arab conquered West Asia, Jordan Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Persia. They\\nalso conquered parts of North Africa and Southern Europe. Between AD 639–637, Egypt\\nwas also conquered. By AD 712, the Arabs had entered Spain and were soon making\\ninroads into Southern France. By the 8th Century AD, the Arabs had acquired a core\\nposition from Spain to India, connecting the trade of Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.\\nDuring the early years of the 8th Century, the Umayyads reached the height of their\\npower. They had created the largest ever-Mulsim state that existed. Arabs were also\\nattracted by the wealth of India. Arab merchants and sailors had brought back stories of\\ngreat wealth of India. However, the reason for the invasion of Sindh was to avenge the\\nplunder of Arab Ships by pirates of Debol. King Dahir refused to punish the pirates.\\nHajjaj the governor of Iraq despatched an army under Muhammad Bin Qasim. He\\narrived in Sind in AD 712, and besieged Debol which was situated on the sea coast.\\nAfter crossing the Indus he marched forward. At Rawar, Muhammad Bin Qasim at-\\ntacked Dahir who was defeated. Arabs killed a large number of fleeing soldiers. Dahir\\nwas also caught and killed. Muhammad Bin Qasim now proceeded forward and within\\na short span he conquered various important places in Sind including Brahmanabad.\\n135\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nThe economic life of Sind got disturbed as a result of campaigns of Qasim. A large number\\nof people and merchants had fled from Sind. He had conquered the major portion of Sind up\\nto the lower Punjab. His rule lasted only for two years. However many Arabs settled down\\nin Sind and established relations with the local population. The Arab influence continued for\\na long period with pockets of Muslim influence established in various parts of Sind.\\n9.2 MAHMUD GHAZNI\\nIn all Mahmud Ghazni invaded India 17 times during AD 1000–1026. Mahmud Ghazni\\nwas Son of Sabuktigin, the founder of Ghazni dynasty & Turkish slave commander.\\nMahmud Ghazni first encountered the Hindushai ruler, Jaipal in AD 1001. In the\\nyears AD 1004–06 Mahmud Ghazni attacked the rulers of Multan. Soon Punjab also\\npassed into the hands of the Ghaznavids. Between AD 1014–1019, Mahmud en-\\nriched his treasury by looting the temples of Nagarkot, Thanesar, Mathura and Kanauj.\\nThe attack against Nagarkot in AD 1008 has been described as his first great tri-\\numph. In AD 1025, Mahmud embarked on the most ambitious Indian campaign, the\\nattack on the Somnath temple in Saurashtra. Mahmud captured the city after grim\\nstruggle in which more than 50,000 defenders lost their lives. Mahmud left Somnath\\nafter a fortnight when he came to know that the Gujarat king Bhima-I had completed\\npreparations to confront him. His attacks on India were an attempt to fulfil his ambi-\\ntion to make Ghazni the formidable power in the politics of Central Asia. Mahmud’s\\nraids into India were only to acquire the famous wealth of India. This wealth would\\nhelp him to consolidate his vast rule in Central Asia. He did not wish to establish an\\nempire in India. The Ghaznavids had their control on parts of Punjab and Sind which\\ncontinued till AD 1135. However his invasions exposed the weak defence of Indian\\nkingdoms. They also opened possibility of attacks in future by the Turks.\\n9.3 MUHAMMAD GHORI (SHAHABUDDIN MUHAMMAD)\\nIn AD 1173 Shahabuddin Muhammad (AD 1173–1206) also called Muhammad of Ghor\\nascended the throne of Ghazni. The Ghoris were not strong enough to meet the growing\\npower and strength of the Khwarizmi Empire; they realised that they could gain nothing in\\nCentral Asia. This forced Ghori to turn towards India to fulfil his expansionist ambitions.\\nMuhammad Ghori was very much interested in establishing permanent empire in\\nIndia and not merely looting its wealth. His campaigns were well organised and\\nwhenever he conquered any territory, he left a general behind to govern it in his\\nabsence. His invasions resulted in the permanent establishment of the Turkish Sul-\\ntanate in the region lying north of the Vindhya Mountains.\\nConquest of Punjab and Sind\\nMuhammad Ghori led his first expedition in AD 1175. He marched against Multan\\nand freed it from its ruler. In the same campaign he captured Uchch from the Bhatti\\nRajputs. Three years later in AD 1178 he again marched to conquer Gujarat but the\\nChalukya ruler of Gujarat, Ghima II defeated him at the battle of Anhilwara. But this\\ndefeat did not discourage Muhammad Ghori. He realised the necessity of creating a\\nsuitable base in Punjab before venturing on the further conquest of India.\\nHe launched a campaign against the Ghaznavid possessions in Punjab. As a result\\nPeshawar was conquered in AD 1179–80 and Lahore in AD 1186. The fort of Sialkot\\nand Debol were captured next. Thus by AD 1190 having secured Multan, Sind and Punjab,\\nMuhammad Ghori had paved the way for a further thrust into the Gangetic Doab.\\n136\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nThe First Battle of Tarain (AD 1191)\\nMuhammad Ghori’s possession of Punjab and his attempt to advance into the Gangetic\\nDoab brought him into direct conflict with the Rajput ruler Prithivaraja Chauhan. He\\nhad overrun many small states in Rajputana, captured Delhi and wanted to extend his\\ncontrol over Punjab and Ganga valley. The conflict started with claims of Bhatinda.\\nIn the first battle fought at Tarain in AD 1191, Ghori’s army was routed and he\\nnarrowly escaped death. Prithviraj conquered Bhatinda but he made no efforts to\\ngarrison it effectively. This gave Ghori an opportunity to re-assemble his forces and\\nmake preparations for another advance into India.\\nThe Second Battle of Tarain (AD 1192)\\nThis battle is regarded as one of the turning points in Indian History. Muhammad Ghori\\nmade very careful preparations for this conquest. The Turkish and Rajput forces again\\ncame face to face at Tarain. The Indian forces were more in number but Turkish\\nforces were well organised with swift moving cavalry. The bulky Indian forces were\\nno match against the superior organisation, skill and speed of the Turkish cavalry. The\\nTurkish cavalry was using two superior techniques. The first was the horse shoe which\\ngave their horses a long life and protected their hooves. The second was, the use of\\niron stirrup which gave a good hold to the horse rider and a better striking power in the\\nbattle. A large number of Indian soldiers were killed. Prithviraj tried to escape but was\\ncaptured near Sarsuti. The Turkish army captured the fortresses of Hansi, Sarsuti and\\nSamana. Then they moved forward running over Delhi and Ajmer.\\nAfter Tarain, Ghori returned to Ghazni, leaving the affairs of India in the hand of his\\ntrusted slave general Qutbuddin Aibak. In AD 1194 Muhammad Ghori again returned\\nto India. He crossed Yamuna with 50,000 cavalry and moved towards Kanauj. He\\ngave a crushing defeat to Jai Chand at Chandwar near Kanauj. Thus the battle of\\nTarain and Chandwar laid the foundations of Turkish rule in Northern India.\\nThe political achievements of Muhammad Ghori in India were long lasting than those\\nof Mahmud of Ghazni. While Mahmud Ghazni was mainly interested in plundering\\nMuhammad Ghori wanted to establish his political control. His death in AD 1206 did\\nnot mean the withdrawal of the Turkish interests in India. He left behind his slave\\nGeneral Qutbuddin Aibak who became first Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 9.1\\n1.\\nFill in the blanks:\\na) Sultan Muhammad Ghori was the ruler of \\n.\\nb) The First battle of Tarain was fought between \\n and\\n.\\nc) Muhammad Ghori entrusted his Indian possession to \\n.\\n2.\\nWhen was the Second battle of Tarain fought?\\n3.\\nWhat was the one major difference between the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni and\\nMuhammad of Ghor?\\n137\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\n9.4 THE MAMLUK SULTANS\\nWith Qutbuddin Aibak, begins the period of Mamluk Sultans or the slave dynasty.\\nMamluk is an Arabic word meaning “owned”. It was used to distinguish the imported\\nTurkish slaves meant for military service from the lower slaves used as domestic\\nlabour or artisan. The Mamluk Sultans ruled from AD 1206 to 1290.\\nQutbuddin Aibak (AD 1206–1210)\\nQutbuddin Aibak was a Turkish slave who had risen to high rank in Muhammad\\nGhori’s army. After Muhammad Ghori’s death in AD 1206, the control of his\\nIndian possessions was passed on to Qutbuddin Aibak. Aibak was the first inde-\\npendent Muslim ruler of Northern India, the founder of Delhi Sultanate.\\nAibak had to face many revolts from Rajputs and other Indian chiefs. Tajuddin\\nYaldauz, the ruler of Ghazni, claimed his rule over Delhi. Nasiruddin Qabacha,\\nthe governor of Multan and Uchch aspired for independence. Aibak was able to\\nwin over his enemies by conciliatory measures as well as a display of power. He\\ndefeated Yaldauz and occupied Ghazni. The successor of Jaichand, Harishchandra\\nhad driven out the Turks from Badayun and Farukhabad. Aibak re-conquered\\nboth Badayun and Farukhabad.\\nQutbuddin Aibak was brave, faithful and generous. Due to his generosity he was\\nknown as “Lakh Baksh”. Most of the scholars consider Aibak as the real founder\\nof Mulsim rule in India.\\nIltutmish (AD 1210–1236)\\nIn AD 1210, Aibak died of injuries received in a fall from his horse while playing chaugan\\n(Polo). After his death a few amirs raised his son Aram Shah to the throne in Lahore.\\nBut Aram Shah was incapable ruler and the Turkish amirs opposed him. The Turkish\\nchiefs of Delhi invited the governor of Badayun (son-in-law of Qutbuddin Aibak)\\n“Iltutmish” to come to Delhi. Aram Shah proceeded against him at the head of the army\\nfrom Lahore to Delhi but Iltutmish defeated him and became the Sultan with the name\\nof Shamsuddin. The credit of consolidating the Delhi Sultanate lies largely with him.\\nWhen Iltutmish ascended the throne, he found himself surrounded with many prob-\\nlems. Other commanders of Muhammad Ghori like Yaldauz, Qubacha and Ali Mardan\\nrose in defiance again. The chief of Jalor and Ranthambore joined Gwalior and Kalinjar\\nin declaring their independence. Apart from this, the rising power of Mongols under\\nChenghiz Khan threatened the North West Frontier of the Sultanate.\\nIltutmish took up the task of consolidating his position. He defeated Yaldauz in AD 1215\\nin the battle of Tarain. In AD 1217 he drove away Qabacha from Punjab. In AD 1220,\\nwhen Chenghiz Khan destroyed the Khwarizm expire, Iltutmish realised the political\\nnecessity of avoiding a confrontation with the Mongols. Thus when Jalaluddin\\nMangbarani, the son of the Shah of Khwarizm, while escaping from the Mongols,\\nsought shelter at Iltutmish’s court, Iltutmish turned him away. He thus saved the Sultan-\\nate from destruction by the Mongols.\\nFrom AD 1225 onwards, Iltutmish engaged his armies in suppressing the disturbances\\nin the East. In AD 1226–27 Iltutmish sent a large army under his son Nasiruddin Mahmud\\nwhich defeated Iwaz Khan and brought Bengal and Bihar back into the Delhi Sultan-\\nate. Similarly a campaign was also launched against the Rajput chiefs. Ranthambore\\nwas captured in AD 1226 and by AD 1231 Iltutmish had established his authority over\\nMandor, Jalore, Bayana and Gwalior.\\n138\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nThere is no doubt that Iltutmish completed the unfinished work of Aibak. The Delhi Sul-\\ntanate now covered a sizeable territory. Besides this, he also organised his trusted nobles\\nor officers into a group of “Forty” (Turkan-i-Chahalgani). He was a farsighted ruler\\nand he consolidated and organised the newly formed Turkish Sultanate in Delhi.\\nIltutmish established ‘Group of Forty’ (Turkan-i-Chahalgani). These were Turkish\\namirs (nobles) who advised and helped the Sultan in administering the Sultanate.\\nAfter the death of Iltutmish, this group assumed great power in its hands. For a\\nfew years they decided on the selection of Sultans one after the other. The group\\nwas finally eliminated by Balban.\\nIltutmish effectively suppressed the defiant amirs of Delhi. He separated the Delhi\\nSultanate from Ghazni, Ghor and Central Asian politics. Iltutmish also obtained a ‘Let-\\nter of Investiture’ in AD 1229 from the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad to gain legitimacy.\\nIltutmish made a significant contribution in giving shape to administrative institution\\nsuch as iqtas, army and currency system. He gave the Sultanate two of its basic\\ncoins– the silver ‘Tanka’ and the copper ‘Jittal’. To affect greater control over the\\nconquered areas Iltutmish granted iqtas (land assignments in lieu of cash salaries) to\\nhis Turkish officers on a large scale. The recipients of “iqtas” called the “iqtadars”\\ncollected the land revenue from the territories under them. Out of this they main-\\ntained an armed contingent for the service of the state, enforced law and order and\\nmet their own expenses. Iltutmish realized the economic potentiality of the Doab and\\nthe iqtas were distributed mainly in this region. This secured for Iltutmish the finan-\\ncial and administrative control over one of the most prestigious regions of North\\nIndia. (You will read details of administration in lesson 12)\\nRaziya  (AD 1236–40)\\nThe problem of successor troubled Iltutmish during his last days. Iltutmish did not\\nconsider any of his sons worthy of the throne. His own choice was his daughter\\nRaziya hence he nominated her as his successor. But after his death his son Ruknuddin\\nFiroz ascended the throne with the help of army leaders. However with the support\\nof the people of Delhi and some military leaders, Raziya soon ascended the throne.\\nDespite her obvious qualities, Raziya did not fare significantly better primarily be-\\ncause of her attempts to create a counter nobility of non-Turks and invited the wrath\\nof the Turkish amirs. They were particularly incensed over her decision to appoint the\\nAbyssinian, Malik Jamaluddin Yaqut, as the amir-i-akhur (master of the horses); the\\nrecruitment of a few other non-Turks to important posts further inflamed matters.\\nThe nobility realized that, though a woman, Raziya was not willing to be a puppet in\\ntheir hands, therefore the nobles started revolting against her in the provinces. They\\naccused her of violating feminine modesty and being too friendly to an Abbyssinian\\nnoble, Yaqut. She got killed after she was defeated by the nobles. Thus her reign was\\na brief one and came to end in AD 1240.\\nNasiruddin Mahmud (1246–66 AD)\\nThe struggle for power between Sultan and the Turkish Chiefs “Chahalgani” which\\nbegan during the reign of Raziya continued. After Raziya’s death, the power of\\nChahalgani increased and they became largely responsible for making and unmak-\\ning of kings. Behram Shah (AD 1240–42) and Masud Shah (AD 1242–46) were\\nmade Sultans and removed in succession. After them, in AD 1246, Ulugh Khan (later\\n139\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nknown as Balban) placed the inexperienced and young Nasiruddin (grandson of\\nIltutmish) on throne and himself assumed the position of Naib (deputy). To further\\nstrengthen his position, he married his daughter to Nasiruddin. Sultan Nasiruddin\\nMahmud died in AD 1265. According to Ibn Battuta and Isami, Balban poisoned his\\nmaster Nasiruddin and ascended the throne.\\nBalban (AD 1266–87)\\nThe struggle between the sultan and the Turkish nobles continued, till one of the Turkish\\nchiefs, Ulugh Khan, known in history by the name of Balban, gradually arrogated all\\npower to himself and finally ascended the throne in AD 1266. When Balban became\\nthe Sultan, his position was not secure. Many Turkish chiefs were hostile to him; the\\nMongols were looking forward for an opportunity for attacking the Sultanate, the\\ngovernors of the distant provinces were also trying to become independent rulers, the\\nIndian rulers were also ready to revolt at the smallest opportunity.\\nThe law and order situation in the area around Delhi and in the Doab region had deterio-\\nrated. In the Ganga-Yamuna doab and Awadh, the roads were infested with the robbers\\nand dacoits, because of which the communication with the eastern areas had become\\ndifficult. Some of the Rajput zamindars had set up forts in the area, and defied the govern-\\nment. The Mewatis had become so bold as to plunder people up to the outskirts of Delhi.\\nTo deal with these elements, Balban adopted a stern policy. In the Mewat many were\\nkilled. In the area around Badayun, Rajput strongholds were destroyed.\\nBalban ruled in an autocratic manner and worked hard to elevate the position of the\\nSultan. He did not allow any noble to assume great power. He even formulated the theory\\nof kingship. The historian Barani, who was himself a great champion of the Turkish\\nnobles, says that Balban remarked ‘whenever I see a base born ignoble man, my eyes\\nburn and I reach in anger for my sword (to kill him).” We do not know if Balban actually\\nsaid these words but his attitude towards the non-Turks was that of contempt. Balban\\nwas not prepared to share power with anyone, not even with his own family.\\nBalban was determined to break the power of the Chahalgani. To keep himself well\\ninformed, Balban appointed spies in every department. He also organised a strong\\ncentralized army, both to deal with internal disturbances, and to repel the Mongols who\\nhad entrenched themselves in the Punjab and posed a serious threat to the Delhi Sultan-\\nate. Balban re-organised the military department (diwan-i-arz) and deployed army in\\ndifferent parts of the country to put down rebellion. The disturbances in Mewat, Doab,\\nAwadh and Katihar were ruthlessly suppressed. Balban also secured control over Ajmer\\nand Nagaur in eastern Rajputana but his attempts to capture Ranthambore and Gwalior\\nfailed. In AD 1279, encouraged by the Mongol threats and the old age of Sultan the\\ngovernor of Bengal, Tughril Beg, revolted, assumed the title of Sultan and had the\\nkhutba read in his name. Balban sent his forces to Bengal and had Tughril killed.\\nSubsequently he appointed his own son Bughra Khan as the governor of Bengal.\\nBy all these harsh methods, Balban controlled the situation. In order to impress the\\npeople with the strength and awe of his government, Balban maintained a magnifi-\\ncent court. He refused to laugh and joke in the court, and even gave up drinking wine\\nso that no one may see him in a non-serious mood. He also insisted on the ceremony\\nof sijada (prostration) and paibos (kissing of the monarch’s feet) in the court.\\nBalban was undoubtedly one of the main architects of the Sultanate of Delhi, particularly\\nof its form of government and institutions. By asserting the power of the monarchy,\\nBalban strengthened the Delhi Sultanate. But even he could not fully defend northern\\n140\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nIndia against the attacks of the Mongols. Moreover, by excluding non-Turkish from\\npositions of power and authority and by trusting only a very narrow racial group he made\\nmany people dissatisfied. This led to fresh disturbances and troubles after his death.\\nBalban adopted a policy of consolidation rather than expansion.  He introduced a\\nnew theory of kingship and redefined the relations between the Sultan and nobility.\\nThrough these measures Balban strengthened the Delhi Sultanate.\\nBalban died in AD 1287. After his death the nobles raised his grandson Kaiquabad to\\nthe throne. He was soon replaced by his son, Kaimurs, who remained on the throne\\nfor a little over three months. During Balban’s reign, Firoz had been the warden of the\\nmarches in north-west and had fought many successful battles against the Mongols.\\nHe was called to Delhi as Ariz-i-Mumalik (Minister of War). In AD 1290 Firoz took\\na bold step by murdering Kaimurs and seized the throne. A group of Khalji nobles led\\nby him established the Khalji dynasty. Some scholars call this event as the ‘dynastic\\nrevolution’ of AD 1290. It brought to an end the so called slave dynasty and Firoz\\nascended the throne under the title of Jalaluddin Khalji.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 9.2\\n1.\\nWhat problems did Iltutmish face on ascending the throne?

He ascended the throne at\\nthe age of 70 years. Although Jalaluddin retained the earlier nobility in his administra-\\ntion, but the rise of Khaljis to power ended the monopoly of nobility of slaves to high\\noffices. Jalaluddin ruled only for a short span of six years. He tried to mitigate some\\nof the harsh aspects of Balban’s rule. He was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate to\\nclearly put forward the view that the state should be based on the willing support of\\nthe governed, and that since the large majority of the people in India were Hindus, the\\nstate in India could not be a truly Islamic state.\\nJalaluddin tried to win the goodwill of the nobility by a policy of tolerance. He avoided\\nharsh punishments, even to those who revolted against him. He not only forgave them\\nbut at times even rewarded them to win their support. However many people includ-\\ning his supporters, considered him to be a weak sultan.\\nJalaluddin’s policy was reversed by Alauddin Khalji who awarded drastic punish-\\nments to all those who dared to oppose him.\\n141\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nAlauddin Khalji (AD 1296–1316)\\nAlauddin Khalji was Jalaluddin’s ambitious nephew and son-in-law. He had helped\\nhis uncle in his struggle for power and was appointed as Amir-i-Tuzuk (Master of\\nCeremonies). Alauddin had two victorious expeditions during the reign of Jalaluddin.\\nAfter the first expedition of Bhilsa (Vidisa) in AD 1292, he was given the iqta of\\nAwadh, in addition to that of Kara. He was also appointed Arizi-i-Mumalik (Minis-\\nter of War). In AD 1294, he led the first Turkish expedition to southern India and\\nplundered Devagiri. The successful expedition proved that Alauddin was an able\\nmilitary commander and efficient organiser. In July AD 1296, he murdered his uncle\\nand father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji and crowned himself as the Sultan.\\nAlauddin decided to revive Balban’s policies of ruthless governance. He decided to\\ncurb the powers of the nobles and interference of Ulema in the matters of the state.\\nHe also faced, a few rebellions in succession during the early years of his rule.\\nAccording to Barani, the author of Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Alauddin felt that there\\nwere four reasons for these rebellions: 1) The inefficiency of the spy system, 2) the\\ngeneral practice of the use of wine, 3) Social intercourse among the nobles and inter\\nmarriage between them and 4) the excess of wealth in the possession of certain nobles.\\nIn order to prevent the reoccurrence of these rebellions, Alauddin formulated certain\\nregulations and implemented them. (1) Families that had been enjoying free land to sup-\\nport themselves should pay land tax for their holdings. This curbed the excess of wealth\\nowned by some people. (2) The Sultan reorganized the spy system and took measure to\\nmake it more effective. (3) The use of liquor and intoxicants was prohibited. (4) The nobles\\nwere ordered not to have social gatherings or inter-marriages without his permission.\\nAlauddin established a huge permanent, standing army to satisfy his ambition of con-\\nquest and to protect the country from Mongol invasion.\\nMarket Regulations of Alauddin Khalji\\nAlauddin’s measures to control the markets were one of the most important policy\\ninitiative. Since Alauddin wanted to maintain a large army, he therefore, lowered\\nand fixed the price of the commodities of daily use.  To control the prices, Alauddin\\nset up three different markets for different commodities in Delhi.  These markets\\nwere the grain market (Mandi), cloth market (Sarai Adl) and the market for\\nhorses, slaves, cattles, etc.  To ensure implementation, Alauddin appointed a super-\\nintendent (Shahna-i-Mandi) who was assisted by an intelligence officer. Apart\\nfrom Shahna-i-Mandi, Alauddin received daily reports of the market from two\\nother independent sources, barid (intelligence officer) and munhiyans (secret\\nspies). Any violation of Sultan’s orders resulted in harsh punishment, including ex-\\npulsion from the capital, imposition of fine, imprisonment and mutilation.\\nControl of prices of horses was very important for the Sultan because without the\\nsupply of good horses at reasonable price to army, the efficiency of the army could\\nnot be ensured.  Low price in the horse market were ensured by putting a stop to\\nthe purchase of horses by horse dealers and brokers (dalals) in Delhi market.\\nExpansion of Delhi Sultanate\\nUnder Alauddin Khalji the territorial expansion of the Delhi Sultanate, beyond North\\nIndia, was the most important achievement.\\n142\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nAlauddin first began his territorial conquest with a campaign against Gujarat. Alauddin was\\nmotivated by his desire to establish a vast empire and obtain the wealth of Gujarat. The\\nriches of Gujarat were to pay for his future conquests and her sea port was to ensure a\\nregular supply of Arab horses for his army. In AD 1299, an army under two of Alauddin’s\\nnoted generals Ulugh Khan and Nusarat Khan marched against Gujarat. Rai Karan the ruler\\nof Gujarat fled, the temple of Somnath was captured. An enormous booty was collected.\\nEven the wealthy Muslim merchants were not spared. Many slaves were captured. Malik\\nKafur was one among them who later became the trusted commander of the Khalji forces\\nand led the invasions to South India. Gujarat now passed under the control of Delhi.\\nAfter the annexation of Gujarat, \\nAlauddin turned his attention towards Rajasthan. Ranthambore\\nwas the first target. Ranthambore was reputed to be the strongest fort of Rajasthan and had\\nearlier defied Jalaluddin Khalji. The capture of Ranthambore was necessary to break the\\npower and morale of the Rajputs. The immediate cause of attack was that the ruler of\\nRanthambore Hamirdeva gave shelter to two rebellious Mongol soldiers and refused to hand\\nover them to the Khalji ruler. Hence an offensive was launched against Ranthambore. To\\nbegin with the Khalji forces suffered losses. Nusrat Khan even lost his life. Finally Alauddin\\nhimself had to come on the battle filed. In AD 1301, the fort fell to Alauddin.\\nIn AD 1303, Alauddin besieged Chittor, another powerful state of Rajputana. According to\\nsome scholars, Alauddin attacked Chittor because he coveted Padmini, the beautiful\\nqueen of Raja Ratan Singh. However many scholars do not agree with this legend as\\nthis is first mentioned by Jaisi in his Padmavat more than two hundred years later.\\nAccording to Amir Khusrau, the Sultan ordered a general massacre of the civil popula-\\ntion. Chittor was renamed Khizrabad after the name of Sultan’s son Khizr Khan. Alauddin\\nhowever returned back quickly to Delhi as Mongol army was advancing towards Delhi.\\nIn AD 1305, Khalji army under Ain-ul-Mulk captured Malwa. Other states such\\nas Ujjain, Mandu, Dhar and Chanderi were also captured. After the conquest of\\nMalwa, Alauddin sent Malik Kafur to the South and himself attacked Siwana.\\nThe ruler of Siwana Raja Shital Deva defended the fort bravely but was ulti-\\nmately defeated. In AD 1311, another Rajput kingdom Jalor was also captured.\\nThus by AD 1311, Alauddin had completed the conquest of large parts of Rajputana\\nand became the master of North India.\\nDeccan and South India\\nThe imperialist ambitions of Alauddin were not satisfied with the conquest of the\\nnorth. He was determined to conquer south as well. The wealth of the southern\\nkingdoms attracted him. The expeditions to the south were sent under Malik Kafur, a\\ntrusted commander of Alauddin who held the office of the Naib.\\nIn AD 1306–07, Alauddin planned fresh campaign in Deccan. His first target was Rai Karan\\n(the earlier rule of Gujarat), who had now occupied Baglana, and defeated him. The second\\nexpedition was against Rai Ramachandra, the ruler of Deogir who had earlier promised to pay\\ntribute to Sultan but did not pay. Ramachandra surrendered after little resistance to Malik Kafur\\nand was treated honourably. He was kept a guest at Alauddin’s court and was given a gift of\\none lakh tankas and the title of Rai Rayan. He was also given a district of Gujarat and one of his\\ndaughters was married to Alauddin. Alauddin showed generosity towards Ramachandra be-\\ncause he wanted to have Ramachandra as an ally for campaigns in the South.\\nAfter AD 1309 Malik Kafur was despatched to launch campaign in South India. The\\nfirst expedition was against Pratab Rudradeva of Warangal in the Telengana area.\\nThis siege lasted for many months and came to an end when Rai agreed to part with\\nhis treasures and pay tribute to Sultan.\\n143\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi Sultanate\\nThe second campaign was against Dwar Samudra and Ma’bar (modern Karnataka\\nand Tamil Nadu). The ruler of Dwar Samudra, Vir Ballala III realized that defeating\\nMalik Kafur would not be an easy task, hence he agreed to pay tribute to Sultan\\nwithout any resistance. In the case of Ma’bar (Pandya Kingdom) a direct decisive\\nbattle could not take place. However, Kafur plundered as much as he could including a\\nnumber of wealthy temples such as that of Chidambaram. According to Amir Khusrau,\\nKafur returned with 512 elephants, 7000 horses, and 500 mans of precious stone. The\\nSultan honoured Malik Kafur by appointing him Naib Malik of the empire. Alauddin’s\\nforces under Malik Kafur continued to maintain a control over the Deccan kingdoms.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 9.3\\n1.\\nWhy was the capture of Ranthambore necessary?\\nMap 9.1 Empire of Alauddin Khalji\\n’\\n144\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\n2.\\nWho led the expeditions in the South during Alauddin Khalji’s rule?\\n3.\\nMention two places where expeditions were undertaken during Jalaluddin’s reign.\\n \\n4.\\nList the four regulations issued by Alauddin to curb rebellions.\\nFollowing the death of Alauddin in AD 1316, the Delhi Sultanate was plunged into confu-\\nsion. Malik Kafur sat on the throne for a few days, only to be deposed by Qutbuddin\\nMubarak Shah. During this period, rebellions broke out in Deogir but were harshly sup-\\npressed. Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah was soon murdered and Khusrau ascended the throne.\\nHowever he too did not last long as some dissatisfied officers, led by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq,\\ndefeated and killed him in a battle. Thus only four years after the death of Alauddin, the\\nKhalji dynasty came to end and power passed into the hands of the Tughlaqs.\\n9.6 THE TUGHLAQS (AD 1320–1412)\\nThe founder of the Tughlaq dynasty was Ghazi Malik who ascended the throne as\\nGhiyasuddin Tughlaq in AD 1320 and this dynasty ruled till AD 1412. Giyasuddin rose\\nto an important position in the reign of Alauddin Khalji. After a brief rule Ghiyassuddin\\nTughlaq died in AD 1325 and his son Muhammad Tughlaq ascended the throne.\\nUnder the Tughlaqs the Delhi Sultanate was further consolidated. Many outlying\\nterritories were brought under the direct control of the Sultanate.\\nThe Deccan and South\\nThe regions of the Deccan which were conquered by the Khaljis had stopped paying\\ntribute and were proclaiming independent status. Muhammad Tughlaq while a prince\\n(called Juna Khan) led the early expeditions against Rai Rudra Dev who was de-\\nfeated after a prolonged conflict and Warangal was now annexed under direct con-\\ntrol of the Sultanate. Ma’bar was also defeated. Now the whole region of Telangana\\nwas divided into administrative units and made part of the Sultanate. In contrast to\\nAllauddin Khalji’s policy the Tughlaqs annexed the Deccan region. Muhammad Tughlaq\\neven decided to transfer his capital from Delhi to Deogir and renamed it as Daultabad.\\nIn fact he wanted to control the northern region from this place. Substantial number of\\nnobles, religious men and craftsmen shifted to the new capital. It seems that the idea\\nwas to treat it as the second capital and not abandon Delhi. Later the whole scheme\\nwas given up. However, the plan improved ties between the north and south. Apart\\nfrom territorial expansion the social, cultural and economic interactions also grew.\\nEast India\\nBhanudeva II, the ruler of Jajnagar in Orissa had helped Rai Rudra Dev of Warangal in his\\nbattle against Delhi Sultans. Ulug Khan led an army against him in AD 1324 Bhanudeva II\\nwas defeated and his territory annexed. In Bengal there was discontent of nobles against\\ntheir Sultan. The dissatisfied nobles invited the Tughlaq prince to invade their ruler. The\\narmy of Bengal was defeated and a noble Nasiruddin was installed on the throne.\\nNorth West\\nThe Mongol invasions from the North-West region were rocking the Sultanate on regu-\\nlar intervals. In AD 1326–27 a big Mongol assault under Tarmashirin Khan took place.\\n145\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nTransfer of Capital\\nOne of the controversial measures of Muhammad bin Tughlaq was that he transferred\\nhis capital from Delhi to Deogir (Daultabad). According to Dr. Mahdi Hussain, the\\nSultan wanted to maintain both Delhi and Daultabad as his capitals. As per Barani, in\\nAD 1326–27, Sultan decided to shift his capital from Delhi to Deogir (Daultabad) in the\\nDeccan because it was more centrally located. According to Ibn Batuta, the people of\\nDelhi used to write letters containing abuses to the Sultan, therefore, in order to punish\\nthem Sultan decided to shift the capital. Isami say that it was a place at a safer distance\\nfrom the North West frontier and thus-safe from the Mongols. In view of different\\nversions it is difficult to assign one definite reason for this shift.\\nThe entire population was not asked to leave only the upper classes consisting of\\nshaikhs, nobles, ulema were shifted to Daultabad. No. attempt was made to\\nshift the rest of the population. Though Muhammad bin Tughlaq built a road from\\nDelhi to Deogir and set up rest houses but the journey was extremely harsh for the\\npeople. Large number of people died because of rigorous travelling and the heat.\\nDue to growing discontent and the fact that north could not be controlled from\\nsouth, Muhammad decided to abandon Daultabad.\\nMuhammad Tughlaq decided to secure the frontier. The region from Lahore to Kalanur\\nincluding Peshawar was conquered and new administrative control was established.\\nBesides, the Sultan also planned invasions of Qarachil region (In present day Himachal)\\nand Qandhar but did not succeed. In fact these schemes resulted in heavy loss.\\nMuhammad Tughlaq was very innovative in adopting new policies. He started a new\\ndepartment for the development of Agriculture. It was called Diwan-i Kohi. Peas-\\nants were given financial support to help in arranging seeds for cultivation. This loan\\nwas also given in case of crop failures. Another important measure was to introduce\\ntoken currency to tide over the shortage of Silver. However, this scheme failed\\ncausing great financial loss to the sultanate.\\nToken Currency\\nAnother controversial project undertaken by Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the in-\\ntroduction of “Token Currency”. According to Barani, the Sultan introduced token\\ncurrency because the treasury was empty due to the Sultan’s schemes of conquest\\nas well as his boundless generosity. Some historians are of the opinion that there\\nwas a shortage of silver world wide at that time and India too faced the crisis\\ntherefore, the Sultan was forced to issue copper coins in place of silver.\\nMuhammad introduced a copper coin (Jittal) in place of silver coin (tanka) and ordered\\nthat it should be accepted as equivalent to the tanka. However, the idea of token cur-\\nrency was new in India and it was difficult for traders and common people to accept it.\\nThe State also did not take proper precautions to check the imitation of coins issued by\\nthe mints. Government could not prevent people from forging the new coins and soon\\nthe new coins flooded the markets. According to Barani the people began to mint token\\ncurrency in their houses. However the common man failed to distinguish between\\ncopper coin issued by the royal treasury and those which were locally made. Thus the\\nSultan was forced to withdraw the token currency.\\nMuhammad Tughlaq was succeeded by his cousin Firuz Tughlaq. Under him no new\\nterritories could be added to the Sultanate. He managed to keep large areas intact\\n146\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nwith great efforts. However, the political control of Delhi gradually weakened during\\nthe rule of Firuz’s successors. The invasion of Timur in AD 1398 left the sultanate\\ndesolate. By the end of Tughlaq rule (AD 1412) the Sultanate was confined to a small\\nterritory in north India. A number of regions proclaimed independent status. In the\\neast Bengal and Orissa enjoyed complete autonomy. In eastern UP and large parts of\\nBihar a new independent kingdom of Sharqis emerged. In the Deccan and South\\nVijaynagar empire and Bahmani kingdom became political powers. Large parts of\\nPunjab were occupied by independent nobles. Gujarat and Malwa became fully inde-\\npendent.

Khizr Khan defeated Sultan Daulat Khan and occupied Delhi and founded\\nSayyid dynasty. He did not assume the title of Sultan but was comfortable with Rayat-\\ni-Ala. The author of the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi, Yahya Sirhindi claims that the founder\\nof the Sayyid dynasty was a descendant of the prophet.\\nKhizr Khan was the most competent Sayyid rule of the dynasty. After Khizr Khan’s\\ndeath Mubarak Shah (AD 1412–34) and Muhammad Shah (AD 1434–45) ascended\\nthe throne one after another. All of these rulers tried to control rebellious regions like\\nKatehar, Badaun, Etawah, Patiali, Gwalior, Kampil, Nagaur and Mewat but they failed\\ndue to the conspiracy of the nobles.\\nIn 1445 AD, Alam Shah ascended the throne and became the Sultan. He proved a\\ntotally incompetent Sultan. Alam Shah’s Wazir Hamid Khan invited Bhalol Lodi to\\ntake charge of the army and after realizing that it would be difficult to continue as\\nSultan, Alam Shah left for Badaun.\\n9.8 RECONSOLIDATION UNDER LODI DYNASTY (1451–1526)\\nWith the help of a few nobles Bahlol Lodi (AD 1451–1489) took charge of the army,\\nand became the Sultan. Thus he laid the foundation of Lodi dynasty whose rulers\\nwere Afghans. The Lodis were the last ruling family of the Sultanate period and the\\nfirst to be headed by the Afghans.\\nSultan Bahlol Lodi was a capable general. He was aware of the fact that to establish\\nhis control over Sultanate he would require help and support of Afghan nobles. The\\nAfghan nobles wanted Sultan to treat them as an equal partner rather than an abso-\\n147\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nlute monarch. To placate them Bahlol publicly declared that he considered himself\\none of the Afghan peers and not the king. He did not sit on the throne nor did he insist\\non his nobles standing in his court. This policy worked well throughout his long reign\\nand he did not face any trouble from his powerful Afghan nobles.\\nBahlol Lodi successfully suppressed the revolts in Mewat and Doab. In AD 1476 he\\ndefeated the Sultan of Jaunpur and annexed it to Delhi Sultanate. He also brought the\\nruler of Kalpi and Dholpur under the Suzerainty of Delhi. However, he failed to re-\\noccupy Bengal, Gujarat and the Deccan.\\nAfter the dealth of Bahlol Lodi, Sikandar Lodi (AD 1489–1517) ascended the throne. Sikandar\\nLodi showed little tolerance towards the non-mulsims. He re-imposed jaziya on non-mulsims.\\nSikandar Lodi believed in the superior position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the nobles. He\\ncompelled nobles and amirs to show formal respect to the Sultan in darbar and\\noutside and treated them harshly. He re-annexed Bihar, Dholpur, Narwar and some\\nparts of the kingdom of Gwalior and Nagor to the Delhi Sultanate.\\nAfter the death of Sikandar Lodi in AD 1517 his nobles helped Ibrahim Lodi to become\\nSultan. His reign proved a period of revolts. Firstly his own brother Jalal Khan rebelled.\\nSultan Ibrahim Lodi got him murdered. Bihar declared its independence. Daulat Khan\\nthe governor of Punjab also rebelled. Sultan’s behaviour caused much dissatisfaction.\\nThe rebellions Daulat Khan sent an invitation to Babur at Kabul to invade India.

During more than 300 years of its rule the Delhi sultanate went through various\\nups and downs but survived as a political force. Here we would like to discuss the\\nmajor challenges the sultanate faced.\\nAttacks by Mongols and others\\nSince its inception the major threat to the sultanate came in the form of Mongol\\ninvasions. Mongols were nomadic groups who inhabited the steppes north of China\\nand east of Lake Baikal. They formed a huge nomadic empire under Chengiz Khan\\n148\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nin the 12thcentury. From 13th century onwards they repeatedly attacked the Delhi\\nSultanate. The Sultans as a policy appeased them and also at times confronted. Balban\\nand Allauddin Khalji confronted them with full military might. During Khalji’s time\\nMongols under Qultlug Khwaja even besieged Delhi and caused a lot of damage. The\\nlast significant attack of Mongols was by Tarmashirin during the reign of Muhammad\\nTughlaq. A lot of energy and resources of the Sultans were spent in facing these\\ninvasions but they could not destroy the sultanate.\\nAnother important attack which shook the foundation of the sultanate was by Timur in\\n1398. The weakness of the Delhi Sultanate was made even worse by Timur’s invasion of\\nDelhi (1398). Timur was a son of the Chief of Chagtai branch of Turks. When he invaded\\nIndia he was the master of almost whole of Central Asia. Timur’s raid into India was a\\nplundering raid and his motive was to seize the wealth accumulated by the Sultans of Delhi\\nover the last 200 years. Sultan Nasiruddin and his Wazir Mallu Iqbasl faced Timur but\\nwere defeated. Timur entered Delhi and stayed for 15 days. He ordered general massa-\\ncre and large number of Hindu and Muslim including women and children were murdered.\\nBefore leaving India Timur’s invasion indicated the downfall of Delhi Sultanate. Delhi\\nSultanate lost control over Punjab. Timur appointed Khizr Khan, the ruler for Multan who\\ncontrolled Punjab also. After the fall of Tughlaq dynasty he occupied Delhi and became\\nthe ruler of Delhi Sultanate. He laid the foundation of Saiyyid Dynasty.\\nInner Conflict of Nobility\\nThree hundred years of Delhi Sultanate witnessed five dynasties ruling over it. The\\nmain reason for change of dynasties and deposing of rulers was a constant struggle\\nbetween the Sultan and the nobility (Umara). Soon after the death of Aibak they\\nstarted fighting over the question of succession. Finally Iltutimish emerged victorious.\\nIltutimish created a group of loyal nobles called Turkan-i-Chihiligani (‘The Forty’).\\nAfter the death of Iltutimish various factions of the group of forty got involved in\\nmaking their favourite son/daughter as the sultan. In ten years five sultans were\\nchanged. After that the Sultan who occupied the throne (Nasiruddin Mahmud) for 20\\nyears hardly ruled and one of the powerful noble Balban was defacto sultan. The\\nsame Balban succeeded Nasiruddin after his death. Almost similar events happened\\nafter the death of each powerful sultan (Balban, Alauddin Khalji, Firoz Tughlaq and\\nothers.) Since there was no well defined law of succession each noble tried to either\\ncrown himself or support some favourite heir of the dead sultan. Finally Afghans\\nreplaced the Turks as sultan with the accession of Bahlol Lodi.\\nProvincial Kingdoms\\nAnother consequence of this conflict was declaration of independence by various\\nprovincial heads in the regions. As a result a number of independent Afghan and\\nTurkish kingdoms emerged. Important ones of such states were Bengal (Lakhnouti),\\nJaunpur, Malwa, Gujarat, the Bahmani kingdom in the Deccan etc. Quite often these\\nstates were at war with the Sultanate. The whole process weakened the sultanate.\\nResistance by Indian Chiefs\\nThe sultans had to face the resistance from Indian chiefs at regular intervals. The\\nRajput chiefs in Rajputana (Mewar, Ranthambhor, Chittor etc.), Warangal, Deogiri &\\nMa’bar in Deccan and South, the king of Dhar, Malwa in Central India, Jajnagar in\\nOrissa and a host of smaller chieftains were constantly at war even after successive\\ndefeats. All these struggles weakened the sultanate.\\n149\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nThe Delhi sultanate was considerably weakened after the Khalji and Tughlaq reign.\\nFinally the invasion of Babur in AD 1526 brought it to an end. Now a much more\\ncentralised and strong empire under the Mughals established itself in India and ruled\\nfor a further period of more than two hundred years. We will discuss it in our next\\nlesson on the Mughal Rule. But before moving to the Mughals we provide you a brief\\naccount of the provincial kingdoms.\\nRise of The Provincial Kingdoms\\nYou have read that the process of disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate had started\\nduring the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. However, Firuz Shah Tughlaq tried to\\ncontrol the situation but failed. During this period, some of the provincial rulers de-\\nclared their independence from the rule of the Sultanate.\\nJaunpur\\nJaunpur was a prosperous province in the eastern part of Delhi Sultanate. Malik\\nSarwar was the Governor of Jaunpur. Soon he became the ruler of Kanauj, Kara,\\nAwadh, Sandeela, Dalmau, Bahraich, Bihar and Tirhut. Though Malik Sarwar did not\\nassume the title of Sultan, but he laid down the foundation of Sharqi Dynasty.\\nAfter the death of Malik Sarwar in AD 1399, his adopted son Malik Karanphul\\nsucceeded the throne. He assumed the title of Mubarak Shah and thus was the first\\nruler of Sharqi dynasty. When Mubarak Shah was the ruler of Jaunpur dynasty,\\nduring that time Mahmud Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi was the puppet in the hands\\nof Mallu Iqbal. Mallu Iqbal undertook an expedition to recover Jaunpur but failed.\\nOn Mubarak Shah’s death in AD 1402 his younger brother Ibrahim ascended the\\nthrone. He ruled for 34 years.\\nDuring Ibrahim’s reign the relations between Delhi and Jaunpur became worse. Ibrahim\\nwas the greatest ruler of Sharqi dynasty under whom Jaunpur became an important centre\\nof learning. Under him Jaunpur evolved a distinct architecture which is known as Sharqi\\nstyle of architecture. The most famous of their buildings was the Atala Masjid at Jaunpur.\\nIbrahim’s successor Mahmud conquered the fort of Chunar. He also tried to conquer\\nKalpi but failed. He invaded Delhi but was defeated by Bahlol Lodi. After Mahmud,\\nJaunpur saw the rule of Muhammad Shah and Husain Shah. Husain Shah died in\\nAD 1500 and with him ended the Sharqi dynasty.\\nKashmir\\nShamshuddin Shah (AD 1339) was the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir. In AD 1389\\nSikandar ascended the throne. He was a powerful and despotic ruler. Sikandar died in\\nAD 1416 and his son Ali Shah ascended the throne. After some years his brother\\nShah Khan ascended the throne under the title of Zainul Abidin.\\nZainul Abidin was a liberal and enlightened ruler. To secure the support of all the\\ngroups, he called back all such groups who had been banished by Sikandar. He abol-\\nished ‘jaziya’ and prohibited cow slaughter. Zainul Abidin paid great attention to-\\nwards the economic growth of Kashmir. He himself was a great scholar of Persian,\\nSanskrit, Tibetan and Kashmiri language. He ordered the translation of Mahabharata\\nand Rajatarangini (history of Kashmir) into Persian.\\nZainul Abidin’s successor proved a weak ruler. Taking advantage of his weaknesses\\nMirza Haider, a relative of Babur conquered Kashmir. In AD 1586 Kashmir was\\nannexed by Akbar and became part of the Mughal Empire.\\n150\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nMalwa\\nMalwa was the south-western province of Delhi Sultanate. It was conquered by Sultan\\nAlauddin in AD 1310 and remained the part of Delhi Sultanate till the death of Firuz Tughlaq.\\nDilawar Khan threw off his allegiance to Delhi in AD 1401 after the invasion of Timur. He\\ndid not take the royal title of Sultan. After the death of Dilawar Khan in AD 1405, his son Ala\\nKhan ascended the throne and acquired the title of Hoshang Shah. He made Mandu his\\ncapital. The Hindi Mahal, Jama Masjid, Jahaz Mahal are examples of Mandu architecture.\\nHoshang Shah was succeeded by Ghazi Khan who was deposed by his minister\\nMahmud Khan Khalji in AD 1436. Mahmud assumed the title of Shah and laid the\\nfoundation of Khalji dynasty of Malwa. Under Mahmud Khalji, Malwa became strong\\nand prosperous kingdom. He was a generous king. According to Ferishta he was\\npolite, brave and learned person. Mahmud Khalji was followed by Ghiyasuddin and\\nNasiruddin. Mahmud II ascended the throne of Malwa in AD 1510. He called Medini\\nRai, a powerful Rajput to crush his disloyal nobles and appointed him his prime minis-\\nter. The predominance of Rajputs at the court created jealousy among the Muslims\\nnobles. The Sultan of Gujarat defeated Malwa and annexed Malwa to Gujarat.\\nGujarat\\nGujarat has always attracted the invaders due to its geographical location, pros-\\nperity and fertility. Sultan Alauddin Khalji was the first Sultan who annexed Gujarat\\nto the Delhi Sultanate. Since then it remained under the Turkish governors. At the\\ntime of Timur’s invasion, Zafar Khan was the governor of this province. He\\nthrew off the allegiance to Delhi Sultanate. In AD 1410, he became the indepen-\\ndent ruler of Gujarat. The most famous of the Gujarat rulers was Ahmad Shah\\n(AD 1411 to 1441). To extend his kingdom, he restrained the Rajput States. Ahmad\\nShah founded the city of Ahmedabad.  After the death of Ahmed Shah in AD 1441\\nhis eldest son Muhammad Shah ascended the throne. He was known as Zar-Baksh.\\nHe was killed by conspirators in AD 1451. Muhammad Shah was followed by two\\nweak rulers. Nobles raised Fateh Khan, a grandson of Ahmad Shah to the throne. He\\nruled as Mahmud. Mahmud was the ablest ruler of his dynasty. He ruled for 52 years.\\nMahmud died in AD 1511. He was followed by a number of rulers who had brief\\nreigns. In AD 1572 Akbar conquered Gujarat and annexed it to the Mughal Empire.\\nBengal\\nBengal was the easternmost province of Delhi Sultanate. Lack of proper means of trans-\\nportation and communication created difficulty in controlling this province. Though Bengal\\nwas annexed to the Delhi Sultanate, a number of times it gained its independence. During\\nthe last decade of the 12th century AD Muhammad Bin Bakhitiyar annexed Bengal to\\nthe conquered territories of Muhammad Ghori. But after his death, his successors de-\\nclared their independence with the support of the local people. Balban forced Bengal to\\naccept the sovereignty of Delhi and appointed his son Bughra Khan as its governor. But\\nafter Balban’s death he declared his own independence. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tried to\\nsolve this problem by partitioning Bengal into three independent administrative divisions\\nnamely Lakhnauti, Satgaon and Sonargaon. Muhammad bin Tughlaq tried to declare\\nthe supremacy of Delhi Sultanate but when he was busy in suppressing rebellion in\\nother parts of Sultanate Bengal cut off its connection with Delhi.\\nHaji Iliyas, a noble united Bengal and became its ruler under the title of Shamsh-ud-\\ndin Iliyas Shah. To counter increasing influence of Haji Iliyas Firuz Shah Tughlaq\\ninvaded Bengal but did not meet with success.

The Arabian armies captured the large parts of central Asia and even at-\\ntacked India in 712 AD. The next important invasion into India was when Mahmud\\nGhazni attacked India. His main intention was to carry the wealth of India to Ghazni.\\nIn the 12th century India was divided into small kingdoms mostly ruled by Rajput\\nchiefs. During this time the political condition of central Asia was not good because of\\nwhich Muhammad Ghori was to look towards India for expansion. In AD 1191 (First\\nbattle of Tarain) Muhammad Ghori was defeated by Prithviraj Chauhan. In 1192 (sec-\\nond battle of Tarain) Muhammad Ghori returned and this time Rajput forces were de-\\nfeated. Thus Delhi passed into the hands of Turks. Muhammad Ghori left his Indian\\npossessions in the hands of his trusted slave – general Qutbuddin Aibak which led to the\\nestablishment of Delhi Sultanate. Iltutmish further consolidated the Sultanate by putting\\ndown internal rebellions and conciliating the nobility by forming of ‘Group of Forty’. The\\nlast powerful Sultan of slave dynasty was Balban who became the Sultan in AD 1266.\\nHe ruled in an autocratic manner and worked hard to elevate the position of sultan.\\nAfter the death of Balban in AD 1287, the Khaljis came to the power in AD 1290.\\nThe coming of Khaljis marked a break in the monopoly of Turkish rule. Jalaluddin\\nKhalji laid the foundation of Khalji dynasty. In AD 1296, Alauddin Khalji murdered his\\nuncle and father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji and crowned himself as Sultan. He restored\\nthe prestige of the crown. He suppressed the nobility and ruled as an autocrat. His\\nable general Alp Khan, Nusrat Khan, Zafar Khan, Ulugh Khan, Malik Kafur won him\\nmany victories. Another important measure taken by Alauddin was the establishment\\n152\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment and Expansion of the Delhi sultanate\\nof markets where good were sold at fixed prices and did not allow any trader to earn\\nmore profit. He set up different markets for different commodities in Delhi.\\nThe Khalji dynasty was followed by the Tughlaqs. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq ascended the\\nthrone in AD 1320. He was succeeded by Muhammad Tughlaq in AD 1325. Muhammad\\nTughlaq is famous for his innovative projects. These projects included the transfer of his\\ncapital from Delhi to Daultabad, and introduction of token currency. Following the death\\nof Muhammad Tughlaqs, the amirs and ulemas placed Firuz Tughlaq on the throne.\\nDuring his reign the forces of disintegration were active. In AD 1398 Timur invaded the\\nDelhi Sultanate in order to plunder it. The invasion of Timur gave an opportunity to the\\nprovincial Kingdoms to declare their independence from the Sultanate.\\nMalik sarwar began to rule as a defacto ruler of Jaunpur. Another province Malwa also\\nthrew its allegiance to Delhi Sultanate and its ruler Mahmud Khalji expanded the bound-\\naries of Malwa. Gujarat broke away from the Sultanate when its governor Zafar Khan\\nbegan ruling as an independent ruler. The most famous ruler of Gujarat was Ahmad\\nShah who founded Ahmedabad. The most remarkable ruler of the provincial Kingdoms\\nwas Zainal Abidin the ruler of Kashmir. Under him Kashmir became a strong and\\nprosperous state.  Bengal the Eastern most province of the Sultanate was annexed\\nmany times to Delhi Sultanate but repeatedly gained its independence. Haji Iliyas united\\nBengal which was divided into three administrative divisions by Delhi Sultanate.\\nTimur appointed Khizr Khan as the ruler of Multan, who laid the foundation of\\nSayyid dynasty. This dynasty was replaced by Afghans as the Lodi dynasty\\nfounded by Bahlol Lodi in AD 1451. Bahlol Lodi was a capable ruler who was\\nable to win the support of his nobles. He was followed by Sikander Lodi. The last\\nof the Lodis, Ibrahim Lodi was defeated by Babur in AD 1526 in the battle of\\nPanipat.

During this period the rulers were Turks and Afghans. You must\\nhave noticed that throughout the Sultanate period there was constant struggle between\\nthe various Turkish groups and Afghans. The disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate led to\\nthe emergence of various regional powers. Therefore, when Babur invaded India in\\n1526 the central power of the Sultanate had substantially weakened and there were a\\nnumber of independent kingdoms. The Delhi and adjoining regions were under Sultan\\nIbrahim Lodi. Other Important kingdoms were Gujarat, Malwa, Bengal, Bijapur, Golconda,\\nAhmednagar, Berar, Mewar and Vijaynagar empire in the South. Besides, a large num-\\nber of smaller autonomous chiefs were also ruling in different parts of the country.\\nIn this lesson you will study about the conquest of India by a new ruling\\ndynasty-the Mughals. The Mughals were led by an able military commander and administra-\\ntor from Central Asia named Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur. His successors were success-\\nful in establishing an all India empire gradually. We will study the details of this process of\\nconquests and consolidation in this lesson. Let us begin with the advent of Babur in India.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson you would be able to:\\n \\nknow the circumstances under which Babur invaded India;\\n \\ndescribe the reasons for the success of the Mughals against Indian rulers;\\n \\nlist the challenges faced by Humayun after Babur’s death;\\n \\nanalyse the circumstances that led to the defeat of Humayun and revival of\\nAfghan power;\\n \\ndescribe the events leading to recapture of India by Humayun;\\n \\ngive an account of the expansion and consolidation of the Mughal empire under Akbar;\\n \\ndescribe the territorial expansion upto the reign of Aurangzeb and\\n \\nanalyse the challenges faced by the Mughal empire in India.\\n10.1 ADVENT OF BABUR (1526–30)\\nBabur ascended the throne at Farghana, a small principality in Transoxiana, in 1494 at\\nthe age of twelve after the death of his father. The situation in Central Asia was not\\n156\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\nstable and Babar had to face a lot of resistance from the nobility itself. Although he\\nwas able to capture Samarqand but very soon he had to retreat because of desertion\\nof some of his nobles. He also lost Farghana to the Uzbegs.\\nThus, the early years of Babur’s rule in central Asia were tough. During this whole\\nperiod he had plans of moving towards Hindustan. And finally from 1517 onwards he\\nmade decisive moves towards India. A few developments in India at that time also\\nhelped him to act on plans of invading India.\\nTimurids\\nBabur traced his linage from Timur the great conqueror of Central Asia and to\\nChengiz Khan the distinguished conqueror.  From mother’s side he was a descen-\\ndant of Mongols and from father’s side the great commander Timur.  Because of\\nthe lineage of Timur the Mughals are also referred as Timurids.\\nThe unstable political situation in India after Sikandar Lodi’s death convinced him of politi-\\ncal discontentment and disorder in the Lodi Empire. Meanwhile there was conflict be-\\ntween some Afghan chiefs with Ibrahim Lodi. Prominent among them was Daulat Khan\\nLodi, the Governor of a large part of Punjab. The Rajput king of Mewar Rana Sanga was\\nalso asserting his authority against Ibrahim Lodi and was trying to increase his area of\\ninfluence in north India. Both of them sent word to Babur to invade India. Invitations from\\nRana Sanga and Daulat Khan Lodi might have encouraged Babur’s ambitions.\\nBabur was successful in capturing Bhira (1519–1520), Sialkot (1520) and Lahore (1524)\\nin Punjab. Finally, Ibrahim Lodi and Babur’s forces met at Panipat in 1526. Babur’s Sol-\\ndiers were less in number but the organization of his army was superior. Ibrahim Lodi was\\ndefeated in the battle of Panipat. Success at the Battle of Panipat was a great achieve-\\nment of Babur’s military tactics. Babur had an active army of only 12000 soldiers while\\nIbrahim’s army had an estimated strength of 100,000 soldiers. When face to face in the\\nbattle field Babur’s tactics were unique. He effectively applied the Rumi (Ottoman) method\\nof warfare. He encircled Ibrahim’s army from two flanks. In the centre his cavalry mounted\\nattack with arrows and gun fires by expert ottoman gunners. The trenches and barricades\\nprovided adequate defence against march of the enemy. The Afghan army of Ibrahim\\nLodi suffered heavy causalities. Ibrahim Lodi died in the battle field. Babur was thus able\\nto take control of Delhi and Agra and got the rich treasure of Lodis. This money was\\ndistributed among Babur’s commanders and soldiers.\\nVictory at Panipat provided Babur a firm ground to consolidate his conquests. But\\nnow he was faced with a few problems:\\ni.\\nHis nobles and commanders were eager to return to Central Asia because they\\ndid not like the climate of India. Culturally also, they felt very alienated.\\nii.\\nRajputs were rallying around under the leadership of Rana Sanga the king of\\nMewar and wanted to expel the Mughal forces\\niii.\\nThe Afghans, though defeated at Panipat, were still a formidable force in eastern\\nparts of UP, Bihar and Bengal. They were re-grouping to reclaim their lost powers.\\nTo begin with Babur convinced his companions and nobles to stay back and help in\\nconsolidating the conquered territories. After succeeding in this difficult task, he sent\\nhis son Humayun to face the eastern Afghans. Rana Sanga of Mewar succeeded to\\n157\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nmuster support of a large number of Rajput chiefs. Prominent among these were\\nJalor, Sirohi, Dungarpur, Amber, Merta etc. Medini Rai of Chanderi, Hasan Khan of\\nMewat and Mahmud Lodi younger son of Sikander Lodi also joined Rana with their\\nforces. Possibly, Rana Sanga expected Babur to return to Kabul. Babur’s decision to\\nstay back must have given a big jolt to Rana Sanga’s ambitions. Babur was also fully\\naware of the fact that it would be impossible for him to consolidate his position in India\\nunless he shattered Rana’s power. The forces of Babur and Rana Sanga met at\\nKhanwa, a place near Fatehpur Sikri. Rana Sanga was defeated in 1527 and once\\nagain the superior military tactics of Babur succeeded. With the defeat of Rana the\\nbiggest challenge in north India was shattered.\\nThough the Mewar Rajputs received great shock at Khanwa, Medini Rai at Malwa\\nwas still threatening to challenge the authority of Babur. In spite of great valour with\\nwhich the Rajputs fought in Chanderi (1528), Babur faced little difficulty in overcom-\\ning Medini Rai. With his defeat, resistance across Rajputana was completely shat-\\ntered. But Babur had to tackle the Afghans. The Afghans had surrendered Delhi, but\\nMap 10.1 Early conquests of the Mughals\\nBhera\\nSialkot\\nLahor\\n158\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\nthey were still powerful in the east (Bihar and parts of Jaunpur). The success against\\nthe Afghans and Rajputs at Panipat and Khanwa was very significant but the resis-\\ntance was still present. However, these victories were a step forward in the direction\\nof the establishment of Mughal empire. Babur died in 1530.

The situation\\nunder Humayun was quite desperate. The main problems faced by Humayun were:\\ni.\\nThe newly conquered territories and administration was not consolidated.\\nii.\\nUnlike Babur, Humayun did not command the respect and esteem of Mughal\\nnobility.\\niii.\\nThe Chaghatai nobles were not favourably inclined towards him and the Indian nobles,\\nwho had joined Babur’s service, deserted the Mughals at Humayun’s accession.\\niv.\\nHe also confronted the hostility of the Afghans mainly Sher Khan in Bihar on the\\none hand and Bahadurshah, the ruler of Gujarat, on the other.\\nv.\\nAs per the Timurid tradition Humayun had to share power with his brothers. The\\nnewly established Mughal empire had two centres of power – Humayun was in\\ncontrol of Delhi, Agra and Central India, while his brother Kamran had Afghanistan\\nand Punjab under him.\\nHumayun felt that the Afghans were a bigger threat. He wanted to avoid a combined\\nopposition of Afghans from east and the west. At that time Bahadur Shah had occupied\\nBhilsa, Raisen, Ujjain and Gagron and was consolidating his power. While Humayun was\\nbesieging Chunar in the east, Bahadur Shah had started expanding towards Malwa and\\nRajputana. In such a situation Humayun was forced to rush back to Agra (1532–33).\\nContinuing his expansionist policy, Bahadur Shah attacked Chittor in 1534. Chittor had\\nstrategic advantage as it could provide a strong base. It would have helped his expansion\\nin Rajasthan particularly towards Ajmer, Nagor and Ranthambhor. Humayun captured\\nMandu and camped there because he thought that from here he can block Bahadur\\nShah’s return to Gujarat. Humayun’s long absence from Agra resulted in rebellions in\\nDoab and Agra and he had to rush back. Mandu was now left under the charge of Mirza\\nAskari, the brother of Humayun. During the period when Humayun was busy in Gujarat\\nto check Bahadurshah, Sher Shah started consolidating himself in Bihar and Bengal.\\n159\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nRise of Sher Shah Suri\\nFarid, who later came to be called Sher Khan and subsequently Sher Shah, was son of a\\nJagirdar under the kingdom of Jaunpur. His father Hasan Khan Sur held the jagir of\\nSasaram in Bihar during the rule of Lodis. Sher Shah helped his father in the administra-\\ntion of his jagir. Later he developed differences with his father and left him. He served\\nunder Afghan nobles. After the death of his father in 1524 he was given his father’s jagir\\nby Ibrahim Lodi. He had to enter into conflict with his family to take possession of the\\njagir. He very effectively managed the Jagir of his father. He also acquired great mili-\\ntary and administrative skills. His capabilities made him the leader of Afghans. He gradu-\\nally increased his influence and defeated Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal. He emerged\\nas the most powerful military commander in the eastern provinces. Sher Shah continued\\nconsolidating his position in Bihar. He had to enter into a number of conflicts with promi-\\nnent Afghan nobles in Bihar and ruler of Bengal. He finally succeeded in establishing\\nhimself as the most powerful Afghan chief in Eastern India.\\nSher Shah wished to establish himself as the undisputed Afghan leader. He invaded\\nthe Bengal army and defeated them in the battle of Surajgarh. Sher Shah could\\nMap 10.2: Empire of Sher Shah\\n160\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\nextract quite a wealth from Bengal which helped him to raise a bigger army. Now he\\nstarted attacking Mughal territories of Banaras and beyond. Humayun was quite\\nsuspicious of Sher Shah’s ambitions but failed to estimate his capabilities. He asked\\nhis governor of Jaunpur, Hindu Beg to check the movements of Sher Shah. Mean-\\nwhile Sher Shah captured Gaur (1538) the capital of Bengal. While Humayun was\\nmoving towards Bengal Sher Shah took control of route to Agra making communica-\\ntion difficult for Humayun. On the other hand, Hindal Mirza, brother of Humayun,\\nwho was supposed to provide supplies for his army, declared his independence. Now,\\nHumayun decided to return to Chunar. When he reached Chausa (1539), he en-\\ncamped on the western side of the river Karmnasa. Sher Shah attacked Humayun at\\nthe bank of the river and defeated him. Sher Shah declared himself as an independent\\nking. Humayun could escape but most of his army was destroyed. With difficulty he\\ncould reach Agra. His brother Kamran moved out of Agra towards Lahore leaving\\nHumayun with small force. Sher Shah now moved towards Agra. Humayun also\\ncame forward with his army and the armies of the two clashed at Kannauj. Humayun\\nwas defeated badly in the battle of Kannauj (1540).\\n10.3 SECOND AFGHAN EMPIRE (1540–1555)\\nSher Shah\\nAs already discussed the first Afghan kingdom under the Lodis was replaced by the\\nMughals under Babur in 1526. After a gap of 14 years Sher Shah succeeded in\\nestablishing the Afghan rule again in India in 1540. Sher Shah and his successors\\nruled for 15 years. This period is known as the period of second Afghan Empire.\\nThe founder of this Afghan rule Sher Khan was a great tactician and able military\\ncommander. We have already discussed his conflict with Humayun. After de-\\nfeating Humayun he became sovereign ruler in the year 1540 and assumed the\\ntitle of Sher Shah.\\nSher Shah followed Humayun on his flight till Sindh in the North West. After expelling\\nHumayun he started consolidating his position in Northern and Eastern India. He\\ndefeated and conquered Malwa in 1542 which was followed by Chanderi. In Rajasthan\\nhe led campaigns against Marwar, Ranthambhore, Nagor, Ajmer, Merta Jodhpur and\\nBikaner. He defeated rebellious Afghans in Bengal. By 1545 he had established him-\\nself as the supreme ruler from Sindh and Punjab to whole of Rajputana in the West\\nand Bengal in the East. Now he turned towards BundelKhand. Here while besieging\\nthe fort of Kalinjar he died in 1545 in an accidental blast of gun powder.\\nDuring his brief rule Sher Shah introduced very important changes in administration\\nand revenue system. The most important ones were:\\ni.\\nX judicial system.\\nSher Shah was succeeded by his son Islam Shah. Islam Shah had to face a number of\\nconflicts with his brother Adil Khan and many Afghan nobles. He died in 1553. The\\nAfghan empire was substantially weakened. Humayun saw an opportunity and moved\\ntowards India. He again captured his lost kingdom by 1555 and ended the second\\nAfghan Empire.\\nIn 1555 Humayun conquered Agra and Delhi and established himself as the emperor\\nof India. Before he could consolidate his position he died after falling from the stairs\\nof the library at Sher Mandal (in Delhi) in 1556.\\n161\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 10.2\\n1.\\nWhy did Humayun fail to defeat Sher Shah?\\n2.\\nHow did Sher Khan emerge as the leader of Afghans?\\n3.\\nList the territories which were brought by Sher Shah under his rule.\\n4.\\nList two important achievements of Sher Shah.\\n10.4 THE MUGHAL EMPIRE FROM AKBAR TO AURANGZEB\\nAkbar\\nAkbar was only thirteen years old at the time of Humayun’s death. When his father\\ndied, Akbar was at Kalanaur in Punjab and therefore his coronation took place in Kalanaur\\nitself in 1556. It was his tutor and Humayun’s favourite and confidant Bairam Khan,\\nwho served as the regent of the Mughal emperor from 1556 to 1560. He became the\\nwakil of the kingdom with the title of Khan-i-Khanan. One of the major achievements\\nof his regency period was the defeat of Hemu and the Afghan forces in the second\\nbattle of Panipat in 1556, who were posing a serious threat to the Mughal Empire.\\nRegency of Bairam Khan 1556–1560\\nBairam Khan remained at the helm of affairs of the Mughal Empire for almost four\\nyears, which is popularly known as Period of Bairam Khan’s Regency. During this\\nphase he appointed his favourite nobles on important positions. Bairam Khan emerged\\nas the most powerful noble. He became very arrogant. A group of nobles were op-\\nposed to him. They managed to influence Akbar also. By this time Akbar also wanted\\nto assume full control. He removed Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan revolted and was\\ndefeated. Akbar pardoned him and asked him to retire. He decided to go to Mecca for\\npilgrimage. He was killed by an Afghan near Ahmedabad. His son later on became an\\ninfluential noble under Akbar and is famous as Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana.\\nAkbar started a policy of expansion after overcoming initial problems and consolidating his\\nhold on the throne. The major political powers spread in different parts of the country were:\\ni)\\nthe Rajputs who were spread throughout the country as independent chiefs and\\nkings, and were concentrated mainly in Rajasthan.\\nii)\\nThe Afghans held political control mainly in Gujarat, Bihar and Bengal.\\niii)\\nKhandesh, Ahmednagar, Bijapur, Golkonda and few other kingdoms in South\\nIndia and Deccan were quite powerful.\\niv) Kabul and Qandhar, though ruled by Mughal factions, were hostile towards Akbar.\\nAkbar through a systematic policy started the task of expanding his Empire. The first\\nstep that Akbar took after the dismissal of Bairam Khan was to put an end to the\\nconflict within the nobility. He demonstrated great diplomatic skills and organizational\\n162\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\ncapabilities in handling it. Akbar started his policy of expansion with central India. In\\n1559–60 the first expedition was sent to capture Gwalior before moving towards\\nMalwa. Malwa in central India was ruled by Baz Bahadur. Akbar deputed Adham\\nKhan to lead the expedition against it. Baz Bahadur was defeated and fled towards\\nBurhanpur. Gondwana, an independent state in Central India ruled by Rani Durgawati,\\nwidow of Dalpat Shah, was conquered and annexed to the Mughal empire in 1564.\\nRajasthan\\nIt seems that Akbar was fully aware of the importance of Rajput kingdoms and wanted\\nthem as allies in his ambition of establishing a large empire. He tried to win over the\\nRajputs wherever possible and inducted them into Mughal service. He also entered into\\nmatrimonial alliances with the Rajput rulers like Bharmal. Raja Bharmal of Amber was\\nthe first to enter into alliance with Akbar. The Rajput kingdoms like Merta and Jodhpur\\nwere also occupied without much resistance. However, Maharana Pratap, the ruler of\\nMewar posed most serious challenge to the Mughal emperor and did not submit before\\nAkbar. After a prolonged struggle and siege of the fort of Chittor, Akbar succeeded in\\ndefeating the Mewar forces. A large number of Rajput soldiers got killed in the war.\\nHowever, it could not be fully subdued and some resistance from Mewar side continued\\nfor a long time. After the fall of Chittor Ranthambhor and Kalinjar were captured. Marwar,\\nBikaner and Jaisalmer also submitted to Akbar. By 1570 Akbar had captured almost the\\nwhole of Rajasthan. The most important achievement of Akbar was that in spite of the\\nsubjugation of the whole of Rajasthan there was no hostility between the Rajputs and the\\nMughals. We will discuss reasons for it in a separate section in this lesson.\\nAfghans (Gujarat, Bihar and Bengal)\\nAkbar’s compaign against Afghans started with Gujarat in 1572. One of the princes,\\nItimad Khan, had invited Akbar to come and conquer it. Akbar himself marched to\\nAhmedabad. The town was captured without any serious resistance. Surat with a strong\\nfortress offered some resistance but was also captured. In a short time most of the\\nprincipalities of Gujarat were brought under his control. Akbar organized Gujarat into a\\nprovince and placed it under Mirza Aziz Koka and returned to capital. Within six months\\nvarious rebellious groups came together and revolted against the Mughal rule and the\\nMughal governor had to cede a number of territories. The leaders of rebellion were\\nIkhitiyar ul Mulk and Mohammad Hussain Mirza. Akbar got the news of rebellion in\\nAgra and he set out for Ahmadabad. Akbar marched at a rapid pace and managed to\\nreach Ahmedabad in ten days. The emperor quickly suppressed the rebellion.\\nBengal and Bihar which were under the control of the Afghans, were paid attention\\nafter the Gujarat expedition. In 1574, Akbar along with Munim Khan Khan-i-Khanan\\nmarched towards Bihar. In a short time, Hajipur and Patna were captured and Gaur\\n(Bengal) was also taken away. With this the independent rule of Bengal was ended in\\n1576. By 1592, the Mughal mansabdar Raja Man Singh also brought the whole of\\nOrissa under the Mughal rule.\\nA series of conflicts arose in some regions of the Mughal empire in 1581. Bengal,\\nBihar, Gujarat and the north-west were main centres of unrest. The Afghans were at\\nthe root of these problems since they were overthrown everywhere by the Mughals.\\nApart from this, Akbar’s policy of strict administration of jagirs was also responsible\\nfor this. A new policy was adopted, according to which the jagirdars were asked to\\nsubmit the accounts of the jagirs. This created dissatisfaction and jagirdars rose in\\nrevolt. Masum Khan Kabuli, Roshan Beg, Mirza Sharfuddin and Arab Bahadur were\\nthe main leader of rebels. Imperial officers posted there tried to crush the rebellion\\n163\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nbut failed. Akbar immediately sent a large force under Raja Todar Mal and Shaikh\\nFarid Bakshi. A little later, Aziz Koka and Shahbaz Khan were also sent to help Todar\\nMal. The rebels declared Akbar’s brother Hakim Mirza, who was in Kabul, as their\\nking. But soon the Mughal forces were able to successfully crush the rebellion in\\nBihar, Bengal and adjoining regions.\\nPunjab and North West\\nIn the Punjab, Mirza Hakim was creating problems for Akbar and he attacked Lahore\\nHakim Mirza was expecting a number of Mughal officers to join him but no large group\\njoined him. Akbar decided to march towards Lahore himself. Hakim Mirza immediately\\nretreated and Akbar controlled the whole region. He gave first priority to organize the\\nprotection of North-West frontiers. After this he marched towards Kabul and conquered\\nthe territory. Akbar gave the charge of Kabul to his sister Bakhtunnisa Begum. Later on\\nRaja Man Singh was appointed governor of Kabul and it was given to him in jagir.\\nAnother important development in the North-West region was the rebellion of Roshanai\\nwho captured the road between Kabul and Hindustan. Roshanai was a sect estab-\\nlished by a soldier who was called Pir Roshanai in the region. His son Jalala was\\nheading the sect who had large following. Akbar appointed Zain Khan as commander\\nof a strong force to suppress the Roshanais and establish Mughal control in the re-\\ngion. Sayid Khan Gakhar and Raja Birbal were also sent with separate forces to help\\nZain Khan. In one of the operations Birbal was killed with most of his forces. Akbar\\nwas greatly disturbed with the death of his trusted friend Birbal. He deputed Raja\\nTodar Mal and Raja Man Singh to suppress the rebellion and they were successful in\\ndefeating the Roshanais. Akbar for a long time had his eyes set on conquering Kash-\\nmir. It was annexed to the Mughal Empire in 1586.\\nSome pockets in Sindh in the North-West were still independent. In 1590 Akbar ap-\\npointed Khan-i-Khanna as governor of Multan and asked him to subdue Bilochis, a\\ntribe in the region and conquer the whole territory. First, Thatta was annexed and\\nplaced as a sarkar in the suba of Multan. The conflict with Bilochis in the adjoining\\nregions continued. Finally, by the year 1595, the complete supremacy of Mughals\\nover North-West region was established.\\nDeccan\\nAfter 1590, Akbar gave shape to a Deccan policy to bring these states under Mughal\\ncontrol. During this period the Deccan states were facing internal tensions and regu-\\nlar conflicts. In 1591, Akbar sent offers to the Deccan states asking them to accept\\nMughal sovereignty, but there was not much success. Now Akbar decided on a policy\\nof agression. The first expedition was dispatched to Ahmednagar under the command\\nof Prince Murad and Abdul Rahim Khan Khanan. In 1595, the Mughal forces in-\\nvaded Ahmednagar. Its ruler Chand Bibi decided to face the Mughals. She approached\\nIbrahim Adil Shah of Bijapur and Qutub Shah of Golkonda for help but with no suc-\\ncess. A fierce conflict followed. After heavy losses on both sides, a treaty was worked\\nout and Chand Bibi ceded Berar to Mughals. After some time Chand Bibi attacked\\nBerar to take it back. At this point Nizamshahi, Qutabshahi and Adilshahi troops\\ndecided to present a joint front. The Mughals suffered heavy losses but could retain\\ntheir position. Meanwhile, serious differences between Murad and Khan Khana weak-\\nened Mughal position. Akbar, therefore, recalled Khan Khanan and deputed Abul\\nFazl to Deccan. After Prince Murad’s death in 1598, Prince Daniyal and Khan Khanan\\nwere sent to Deccan. Ahmednagar was captured. Soon the Mughals also conquered\\nAsirgarh and adjoining regions. Adil shah of Bijapur also expressed allegiance and\\n164\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\noffered his daughter in marriage to Prince Daniyal. Meanwhile Chand Bibi also died. Now\\nMughal territories in Deccan included Asirgarh, Burhanpur, Ahmedanagar and Berar.\\nAlong with the expansion of territory Akbar initiated the policy of absorbing the chief-\\ntains into Mughal nobility. His policy paid rich dividends to the empire. The Mughal\\nemperor succeeded in getting the support of chieftains and their armies for new con-\\nquests. As part of Mughal nobility, their help was also available for administering a\\nlarge empire. In addition, a friendly relationship with them ensured peace for the\\nempire. The chieftains also benefited from this policy. Now they could retain their\\nterritories and administer them as they wished. In addition, they received jagir and\\nmansab. (You would learn about these administrative measures in lesson 12 of Mod-\\nule 2). Often they got territories in jagir bigger than their kingdoms. It also provided\\nthem security from enemies and rebellions. Many Rajput mansabdars were assigned\\ntheir own territories as Watan Jagir, which was hereditary and non-transferable.\\nThe territorial expansion under Akbar gave a definite shape to the Mughal Empire. In\\nterms of territorial expansion very little was added to the empire after Akbar. Some\\nterritories were added during the regions of Shahjahan and Aurangzeb in the Deccan\\nand North East of India.\\nMap 10.3 Extent of Mughal Empire under Akbar\\n165\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nINTEXT QUESTION 10.3\\n1.\\nWhy Akbar removed Bairam Khan?\\n2.\\nWhich were the main political powers in India at the time of Akbar’s accession?\\n3.\\nWhich of the Rajput rulers posed challenge to Akbar and did not submit?\\n4.\\nName the lady ruler who fought with the Mughals? Which was the territory ruled\\nby her?\\nJahangir and Shahjahan\\nJahangir decided to follow Akbar’s expansionist policy in the Deccan. But Jahangir\\ncould achieve little success in it due to certain problems. He could not devote much\\nattention in the crucial phase due to Khurram’s revolt. The Mughal nobles were also\\ninvolved in a number of intrigues and conflicts to gain some advantages from Deccan.\\nDuring the first three years, the Deccan regained half of Balaghat and many districts\\nof Ahmednagar. Malik Ambar was the main ruler who managed to defeat Mughal\\nforces and captured Berar, Balaghat and parts of Ahmednagar. The Mughals could\\nnot regain control of the lost territories. Meanwhile Shah Jahan revolted against his\\nfather and became friends with Malik Ambar.\\nMalik Ambar made an attempt to capture Ahmednagar; but failing there, he took\\naway Sholapur from Adil Shah and in alliance with Shah Jahan tried to capture\\nBurhanpur but failed. Once peace was established between Jahangir and Shah Jahan.\\nMalik Ambar was also pacified. Malik Ambar died in 1627 and was succeeded by his\\nson Fath Khan as Wakil and Peshwa of the kingdom. Fath Khan was arrogant and\\nduring his time the conflict between the Dakhnis and other nobles grew.\\nDuring the reign of Jahangir there was no addition to the Mughal territory in Deccan.\\nIn fact the Deccani rulers weakened the Mughal authority in their states. Over ambi-\\ntion of Malik Ambar was an obstacle in the way of a joint front of the Deccan states.\\nDuring the period between the death of Jahangir and the accession of Shah Jahan, the\\nMughal governor of the Deccan, Khan Jahan Lodi, with the intention of securing help\\nin times of necessity, gave away Balaghat to the Nizam Shah. After ascending the\\nthrone, Shah Jahan ordered Khan Jahan Lodi to recover it but as the latter failed,\\nShah Jahan recalled him to court. Khan Jahan turned hostile and rebelled. He took\\nshelter with Nizam Shah. This infuriated Shah Jahan and he decided to follow aggres-\\nsive policy towards the Deccan states. Shah Jahan’s main concern was to recover\\nthe lost territories of the Deccan. He believed that independence of Ahmednagar was\\nin the way of Mughal control in the Deccan. He decided to isolate Ahmednagar and\\nwin over Bijapur and Marathas. He was successful. Fath Khan son of Malik Ambar\\nalso made peace with Mughals. Now Mahabat Khan was appointed governor of\\nDeccan. But the conflict with Deccan states continued. Finally in 1636 treaties were\\nsigned with Bijapur and Golconda. The main points of agreement with Bijapur were:\\n166\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\ni.\\nAdil Shah accepted the Mughal suzerainty\\nii.\\nHe was to pay 20 lakh rupees as indemnity\\niii.\\nHe was not to interfere in the affairs of Golconda\\niv.\\nMughal emperor was to arbitrate in case of any dispute between Bijapur and\\nGolconda\\nv.\\nAdil Shah to help Mughals in conflict against Shahji Bhonsle\\nGolconda also made a separate treaty. According to this treaty:\\ni.\\nGolconda took oath of loyalty towards Mughal emperor. He agreed to include the\\nname of the Mughal emperor in Khutba and exclude the name of Shah of Iran.\\nii.\\nGolconda agreed to pay two lakh huns per year to the Mughals.\\nThe treaties ended the conflicts in the Deccan. The Mughals could expand their area\\nof dominance to large parts of Southern India. A distinct change in Mughal policy\\ncame towards 1656–57 when the treaties were ignored. Now, Shah Jahan asked\\nAurangzeb to conquer and annex the territories of Deccan kingdoms. It is argued by\\nsome historians that this change of policy was to exploit resources of the Deccan\\nstates for Mughals. However, this change did not benefit the Mughal empire in any\\nsubstantial way and created more problems for future.\\nAurangzeb\\nAurangzeb believed in an aggressive policy towards Deccan. Prof. Satish Chandra\\nidentifies three distinct phases in his policy towards Deccan states.\\ni.\\nFrom 1658 to 1668 the focus was to get hold of the territories of Kalyani, Bidar\\nand Parenda from Bijapur. During this phase attempts were made to secure the\\nhelp of Deccan states against Marathas. The efforts were also made by Jai\\nSingh, the governor of Deccan, to conquer Bijapur but the efforts failed.\\nii.\\nFrom around 1668 to 1684 there was a shift in the policy. The death of Adil Shah of\\nBijapur, growing power of Shivaji and increasing influence of Akhanna and Madanna\\ntwo brothers in Golconda administration affected the Mughal policy. Golconda tried to\\nforge an alliance with Shivaji and Bijapur. Aurangzeb’s efforts to contain Marathas\\nwere not very successful. The alliance with minor shifts and frequent tensions contin-\\nued in some form or the other. Aurangzeb was not inclined to annex the Deccan states.\\niii.\\nIn the third phase (1684–87) Aurangzeb followed the policy of outright annex-\\nation of the Deccan states. Aurangzeb personally supervised the siege of Bijapur.\\nBy 1687 both Bijapur and Golconda along with the territory of Karnataka were\\nannexed in the Mughal empire. The conflict with Marathas continued from 1687\\nto 1707 Aurangzeb spent most of his time in Deccan and could manage to keep\\nthe region under Mughal control. But after his death in 1707 (at Aurangabad in\\nDeccan) they reasserted independence and succeeded in a short period.\\nApart from Deccan Aurangzeb could expand Mughal power in Assam in the north-\\neast region. The major success of the Mughals in this region was annexation of Ahom\\nkingdom (Assam) under Mir Jumla, the governor of Bengal. Another notable achieve-\\nment in north-east was capture of Chatgaon in 1664 under Shaista Khan the new\\ngovernor of Bengal. The Ahom kingdom could not be directly controlled for long. The\\nMughal faujdars posted there had to face resistance and there were regular con-\\nflicts. By 1680 Ahoms succeeded in capturing Kamrup and Mughal control ended.\\n167\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nINTEXT QUESTION 10.4\\n1.\\nWho was the ruler from Deccan who defeated the Mughal forces under Jahangir?\\n2.\\nThe Mughals signed treaty with which of the two states of Deccan in 1636?\\n3.\\nWhich Mughal commander brought the Ahom kingdom under Mughal Control?\\n4.\\nWith which of the Deccan powers Aurangzeb remained engaged for a long time?\\n10.5 CHALLENGES TO MUGHAL RULE: CONFLICTS\\nAND NEGOTIATIONS\\nUnder Aurangzeb, the Mughal empire reached its greatest territorial limits and it covered\\nalmost the whole of present day India. But his reign was marred by popular revolts of the\\nJats, Satnamis, Afghans, Sikhs and the Marathas. The Rajputs emerged as an important\\nsupport base of the Mughals under Akbar, and later on under Jahangir and Shah Jahan.\\nHowever under Aurangzeb they started feeling alienated and gradually lost their position in\\nadministrative set up. The Marathas posed a major challenge to the sovereignty of the\\nMughals under Aurangzeb. Deccan states put up a stiff resistance against Mughal expan-\\nsion plans. The North-West frontier region was also trouble spot and Mughals had to sup-\\npress disturbances. Thus we notice that in the process of the establishment and expansion of\\nMughal empire the Mughals faced resistance and had to negotiate their way through diverse\\nmeans and strategies. Here we will provide a brief discussion on all these issues.\\nRajputs\\nMewar was the only region in Rajputana that had not come under the Mughals during\\nAkbar’s time. Jahangir followed a persistant policy to capture it. After a series of con-\\nflicts, Rana Amar Singh finally agreed to accept Mughal Suzerainty. All the territories\\ntaken from Mewar including the fort of Chittor were returned to Rana Amar Singh and a\\nsubstantial jagir was granted to his son Karan Singh. During the reigns of Jahangir and\\nShah Jahan, the Rajputs generally continued to be friendly with the Mughals and held very\\nhigh mansabs. Shah Jahan relied upon Rajput soldiers for his campaigns in Deccan and\\nthe North West. During the reign of Aurangzeb, the Mughal relations with Rajputs suf-\\nfered, particularly over the issue of the successor to the throne of Marwar. Aurangzeb’s\\ninterference in the succession dispute and his support to the rival candidate antagonised\\nthe Rajputs. His occupation of Jodhpur further put a dent on the Mughal-Rajput relation\\nand the Rajputs gradually got alienated from Mughal rule. In fact, the absence of a pow-\\nerful Rajput section in the nobility ultimately proved detrimental to the Mughal control of\\nthe peripheral areas, specially when it came to negotiating with the Marathas.\\nDeccan\\nDuring the last years of Akbar and early years of Jahangir, Ahmednagar under Malik\\nAmbar started challenging Mughal power. Malik Ambar succeeded in getting support\\nof Bijapur also. A number of expeditions were sent by Jahangir but failed to achieve\\nany success. During Shahjahan’s reign, Mughal conflict with the Deccan kingdoms\\nof Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda was revived. Aghmednagar was first to be\\n168\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\ndefeated and most of its territories were annexed into Mughal empire. By 1636, Bijapur and\\nGolkonda were also defeated but these kingdom were not annexed to the Mughal Empire.\\nAfter a treaty the defeated rulers were to pay annual tributes and recognise Mughal author-\\nity. For almost ten years Shahjahan deputed his son \\nAurangzeb in the region. During \\nAurangzeb’s\\nreign the struggle with Deccan state and Marathas became more intensive. In fact, \\nAurangzeb\\nspent the last twenty years of his reign in Deccan fighting against them. By 1687, the Deccani\\nkingdoms of Bijapur and Golkonda were annexed to the Mughal Empire. However, the time\\nand money spent in the Deccan by Aurangzeb proved a great drain on the Mughal empire.\\nThe Marathas\\nThe Marathas emerged in the Deccan as a vital force under Shivaji in the middle of\\nthe 17th century and began to challenge the Mughal authority. Shiviji started his offen-\\nsive operations in 1656 and captured the principality of Javli. After some time, Shivaji\\nraided the Bijapur territory, and, in 1659, the Sultan of Bijapur sent his general, Afzal\\nKhan, to capture Shivaji. But Shivaji was too clever for him (Afzal Khan) and killed\\nhim. Ultimately, in 1662, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into a peace settlement with\\nShivaji and acknowledged him as an independent ruler of his conquered territories.\\nShivaji now began to devastate the Mughal territories. Aurangzeb sent Shaista Khan,\\nthe viceroy of the Deccan, with a big army against Shivaji and the Treaty of Purandhar\\n(1665) was signed between the two. Out of the 35 forts held by Shivaji, he agreed to\\nsurrender 23 forts to the Mughals. The remaining 12 forts (with annual income of one\\nlakh of huns) were to be left with Shivaji. Shivaji was asked to pay a visit to the Mughal\\ncourt at Agra. But, when Shivaji went there, he was ill-treated and was taken a prisoner.\\nHe managed to escape, reaching Raigarh in 1666. From then onwards, he waged a\\nrelentless struggle against the Mughals. Soon he conquered all the forts which he had\\nsurrendered to the Mughals. In 1670, he plundered Surat for the second time.\\nIn 1674, Shivaji made Raigarh his Capital and celebrated his coronation, and assumed\\nthe title of Chatrapati. Shortly, after this, he made a great expedition into southern\\nIndia and conquered Jinji Vellore and many forts in Karnataka. He died at Raigarh in\\n1680 after ruling for only six years. In this short time he founded the Maratha king-\\ndom, which dominated western India for a century and a half.\\nShivaji’s successor was his son Sambhaji. Many Maratha chiefs did not support\\nSambhaji and extended help to Rajaram the other son of Shivaji. The internal conflict\\nweakened Maratha power. Finally Sambhaji was captured and put to death in 1689 by\\nAurangzeb. Sambhaji was succeeded by Rajaram as his son Sahu was still young. Rajaram\\ndied in 1700. He was succeeded by his minor son Shivaji III under the regency of Tara\\nBai, his mother. The failure of Aurangzeb against the Marathas was largely due to Tara\\nBai’s energy and administrative genius. The Mughals, however, succeeded in dividing the\\nMarathas into two rival camps-one under Tara Bai and the other under Sambhaji’s son,\\nSahu. Sahu, who for long was in the Mughal court, was released. He succeeded in depos-\\ning Tara Bai with the help of a Chitpavan Brahman named Balaji Vishwanath.\\nNorth West\\nAkbar had always considered the Kabul-Ghazni-Qandhar line as the stragetic fron-\\ntier and therefore, captured Qandhar in 1595.\\nDuring the 17th century the North-west frontier was the main area of activity of the\\nMughals. Here, the Roshanais were decisively defeated by 1625–26, but Qandhar\\nbecame a region of conflict between the Persians and Mughals. After Akbar’s death,\\nthe Persians, tried to capture Qandhar but failed under Shah Abbas I, the Safavi ruler.\\n169\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Establishment of the Mughal Rule\\nFollowing this, Shah Abbas I in 1620 requested Jahangir to hand over Qandhar to him\\nbut the latter declined to do so. In 1622, after another attack, Qandhar was captured by\\nthe Persians. Under Shah Jahan, Qandhar once again came into the Mughal hands, but\\nwas recaptured by the Persians in 1649. The struggle to capture Qandahar continued till\\nAurangzeb’s reign but Mughals got little success. Shah Jahan’s Balkh campaign to keep\\nthe Uzbeks (tribe) under control failed miserably and the Mughals lost huge amount of\\nmoney and men in the conflict. During the reign of Aurangzeb, the Qandhar issue was\\ndropped and diplomatic relations with Persia were revived.\\nIt is quite evident that the territorial expansion of Mughal empire achieved under\\nAkbar continued to be the core of the empire. Its further expansion during Aurangzeb’s\\nreign was in Deccan and in small measure in North-East region. During his period the\\nMap 10.4 The Maratha Kingdom under Shivaji\\n170\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEstablishment of the Mughal Rule\\nMughal empire had the largest area. However, the beginning of the decline of the\\nMughal empire also could be traced to the rule of Aurangzeb.

It was both the circumstances in Central Asia and in India\\nwhich played a major role in the foundation of the Mughal empire. Before Babur\\ncould lay the foundation of the Mughal empire, he had to fight many wars with local\\nruling kingdoms. He defeated Ibrahim Lodi at Panipat in 1526. Then he defeated one\\nof the biggest forces in north India, Rana Sanga in 1527. After Babur’s death in 1530\\nhis son Humayun succeeded him. When Humayun was busy in Gujarat, Sher Shah\\nstarted consolidating himself in Bihar and Bengal and moved towards Agra. Humayun\\nwas defeated in the battle of Kannauj in 1540 and Sher Shah was able to establish the\\nsecond Afghan empire which continued from 1540 to 1555. However, in 1555 Humayun\\nwas again successful in capturing Agra, Delhi and other lost territories from the Af-\\nghans and re–established the Mughal rule.

Each of these states has a specific\\nlanguage, geography, food and culture that make the culture of India rich and full of\\nvarieties. Have you wondered how these different states and the regional cultures in\\nthem developed? Were they like this from time immemorial? When we go back to\\nhistory, we realise that these states existed in different forms undergoing a constant\\nprocess of change in different periods of time.\\nIn this lesson, you will study the history of various regional states that existed from\\ntwelfth to eighteenth century. Some of the regional states of this period are today a part of\\none single state. For example, Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Udaipur that existed as independent\\nregional states in the medieval period are all today districts of the state of Rajasthan.\\nSome of the regional states are now a part of more than one state. For example, the\\nVijayanagar Empire (1336–1565AD) is now a part of the modern states of Karnataka,\\nAndhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. There are some regional states that had the same\\nnames as those of the modern states today, but were different in terms of areas they\\ncovered. For example, the modern states of Gujarat, Bengal, Kashmir and Orissa existed\\nfrom twelfth and eighteenth century under same names, but their respective geography\\ntoday is different from what it was in the period between twelfth and eighteenth century.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to:\\n \\ngive brief account of different regional states from twelfth to eighteenth century.\\n \\nUnderstand the meaning of the term regional states?\\n \\nUnderstand the nature of relations between the regional states and the Delhi\\nSultanate and the Mughal Empire.\\n \\nappreciate the relations between various regional states themselves\\n \\nDescribe the political ideas and organisations of these regional states.\\n \\nExplain the Economic and cultural conditions in the regional states.\\n \\nList Some of the primary sources or documents of that time that give us Informa-\\ntion about the regional states.\\n \\nIt is very difficult to provide account of all the regional states in one small lesson\\nonly a few of them have been selected here for the study.

As stated earlier, the Vijayanagar Empire can be found in current\\nstates of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the Bahamani king-\\ndom can be found in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra.\\n3.\\nFrom west India we will study Gujarat, and the Marathas. Gujarat exists with\\nthe same name today, and the Marathas had control over today’s Maharashtra,\\nTamil Nadu and some other parts of India.\\n4.\\nFinally, from eastern India we will study the history of Bengal.\\n11.1 THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM REGIONAL STATE\\nAND REGIONALISM:\\nIn the history of India, there has been a constant evolution and development of re-\\ngionalism and regional states. How does one explain the rise of regional states? From\\nthe seventh century AD onwards which is the early medieval period till the seven-\\nteenth and eighteenth centuries, agriculture and agricultural activities played a very\\nsignificant role in the development of regional states. Wherever, good agricultural\\nactivity took place, it not only fed the population but generated a large surplus that\\ncould be sold and wealth could be generated. Trade and trading activities, overland as\\nwell as maritime, also provided an important source of revenue. One finds the rise of\\npowerful sections in the society that controlled the agricultural surplus. Sometimes,\\nsome members of this powerful section asserted themselves and acquired political\\npower and became kings and established ruling dynasties. This led to laying the foun-\\ndation of the states. Sometimes, some groups came from outside and conquered the\\nland, controlled the administration and became powerful.\\nIt is true that a large number of regional states after thirteenth century arose due to\\ninternal weakness of the Delhi Sultanate. Similarly, with the decline of Mughal Empire,\\nthere emerged important states in the eighteenth century. But all these states had a\\nregional history that pre-dated both the Sultanate and the Mughal state. For example,\\nBengal was an important regional kingdom in the eighth and the ninth centuries under\\nthe Palas and subsequently in the twelfth century under the Senas. It was an important\\nindependent state in the thirteenth and fifteenth century and became a powerful provin-\\ncial kingdom in the eighteenth century too. We all know that Delhi Sultanate and the\\nMughal Empire ruled over numerous and different cultural zones. Even the regional\\nstate of Vijayanagar ruled over different cultural zones. Therefore, it should be remem-\\nbered that regionalism never disappeared though the regional dynasties gained and lost\\npower and the regions changed their geographical boundaries.\\nWhat is this regionalism? Apart from political features, like regional ruling dynasties,\\nthere are some important characteristics of regionalism which developed, evolved\\nand changed over a period of time in these regional states. Some of the characteris-\\ntics of regionalism are as follows:\\n1.\\nOne of the important aspects is language. For example, Oriya, Gujarati, Bengali,\\nTamil, Telugu, Kannada and Marathi and so on Indian languages spoken in vari-\\nous regions of India are referred as regional languages. These languages devel-\\noped in the early medieval and medieval period and were associated with the\\nspecific regions. Though the languages existed in some form or the other, even\\nprior to this but it was primarily from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, that the\\n175\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Emergence of Regional States\\nregional languages came to be used in the official documents. Literary works and\\nlocal literature came to be written in these languages. In the medieval period, simul-\\ntaneous with the use of the regional languages, Sanskrit also came to be used in\\nscholastic texts. However a large number of official documents of the Delhi Sul-\\ntanate and the Mughal Empire and some regional states were written in Persian.\\n2.\\nAnother characteristic is the presence of the local regional cults and religious\\naffiliations. For instance, the cult of Jagannath in Orissa was regional to Orissa.\\nIt became the cult of the state, whereby the rulers adopted it, built a huge temple\\nfor it and celebrated festivals around it every year. Historians say that Jagannath\\nwas a tribal god, whose popularity made the rulers adopt this as the state cult. In\\nthe next section, we will further elaborate about the relationship between the\\nstates and religion. A large number of sects and the bhakti religion developed in\\nthe regions. For example, Namdev, Raidas, Tukaram, Guru Nanak were located\\nin the regional states. Religions also have their own myths, legends and interpreta-\\ntions and religious practices. Did you know that in north India, Kartikeya, the son of\\nShiva and Parvati, is a bachelor and in the Tamil region he has two wives, Devyani\\nand Valli? Each region had different gods and goddesses, different temple and mosque\\narchitectures. Interestingly, despite these regional differences, where each tradition\\nwas specific to a region, there were similarities in the regional traditions too. The\\nsaints and priests migrated from one region to another. For instance, Gesu Daraz,\\n(1321–1422), the Sufi saint, belonged to the Chisti Silsilah that was established in\\nDelhi. He migrated from Delhi to Daultabad in the Deccan region as a child in 1328.\\nSeven years later, in 1335 AD, he came back to Delhi and stayed there for sixty three\\nyears. Towards the end of fourteenth century, in 1398, when Timur, a Turkish invader\\nfrom Central Asia attacked Delhi, Gesu Daraz, migrated back to Deccan.\\n3.\\nThe regional states were not closed isolated areas. Apart from religious interac-\\ntion between the states, there were networks of interaction through trade and\\ncommerce and migration of artisans from one region to another. For example, in\\nthe fifteenth century, the silk weavers, Pattanulkars migrated from the Gujarat\\nregion to the Vijayanagar state. Also one finds migration of the Africans and\\nIranians to the Vijayanagar and Bahamani kingdoms.\\n4.\\n Another characteristic is the development of local and regional art schools like\\nthat Bihar, Bengal, Assam, Central India, and Rajasthan and so on. Regional\\nidentities were formed as a result of process and there have been changes and\\nthey did not exist since time immemorial. The various regional dynasties ex-\\ntended their patronage to art, culture, literature and architecture.\\nThus, the presence of numerous regional states did not imply chaos and confusion.\\nThese states did wage wars amongst themselves, but provided stability over their\\nrespective regions. As discussed above, they had a vibrant culture of their own. The\\nregional states influenced each other in the area of architecture and political culture.\\nFor instance, the early Vijayanagar rulers called themselves as Hindu Suratrana,\\nmeaning Hindu Sultan, where the term Sultan was borrowed from the Delhi sultan-\\nate. Similarly, the iqtadari system of the Delhi Sultanate influenced the administrative\\nsystems of the Vijayanagar and Bahamani kingdoms.\\nWhat is the difference between the regional states and Empire like Delhi Sultanate\\nand the Mughal Empire? Apart from the characteristics mentioned above of language\\nand culture that were specific to one area, the political and military visions of these\\nstates were limited by the regional boundaries.\\n176\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEmergence of Regional States\\nINTEXT QUESTION 11.1\\n1.\\nList any four characteristics of Regionalism in India.\\n2.\\nName the regional art Schools that developed in India during Medieval period.\\n3.\\nWhich bhakti religions developed in the regions of India during Medieval lines.\\n4.\\nList any four characteristics of Regionalism in India.\\n5.\\nName the regional art Schools that developed in India during Medieval period.\\n6.\\nWhich bhakti religions developed in the regions of India during Medieval times.\\n11.2 RISE OF REGIONAL STATES: A GENERAL HISTORY\\nIn the lessons you have studied about the regional states from the seventh to the thirteenth\\ncentury. What happened to these states? Did they disappear completely from medi-\\neval Indian politics? A large number of these regional states continued to exist after\\nthe thirteenth century but there were changes in the ruling dynasties and geography\\nof these states. In this section, you will get a general overview of the regional states\\nfrom the thirteenth to the eighteenth century.\\nThe Delhi Sultanate expanded as a result of the annexation of the states like Bengal,\\nBihar, Gujarat, Malwa, various Rajput states of Rajasthan, like Ranthambor, Jalore,\\nNagore, Ajmer, the Deccan states of Warangal, Telengana, Yadavas of Deogir, and the\\nsouthern states of the Hoysalas of Dwarsamudra, Pandyas of Madurai, and so on. We\\nhave already studied about the various campaigns of Alauddin Khalji and the shift of\\ncapital from Delhi to Daultabad in the Deccan, during Mohammad bin Tughlaq’s period.\\nThose states that were annexed to the Sultanate formed various provinces and were\\nplaced under the administration of the provincial governors. From the establishment of\\nthe Delhi Sultanate in the thirteenth century till its downfall in the fifteenth century, there\\nwas a constant interaction between the provinces that were once upon a time indepen-\\ndent states and the centre, that is, Delhi. However, rebellions from these areas never\\nseized. We all know that as a prince, Muhammmad bin Tughlaq spent his entire career\\nin crushing the rebellions in the Deccan, Orissa and Bengal.\\nThough these regions were now a part of the Delhi Sultanate, the regional character-\\nistics of language, art, literature and religion remained. In fact, when Islam reached\\nhere, it acquired a regional flavour. These states already had settlements of Muslim\\nmerchants and Muslims employed in the army. Though there was hardly any regional\\nruling dynasty, the provincial governors of the Sultanate allied with the local rajas and\\nzamindars and asserted their independence. Most of the regional states that came up\\nafter the fourteenth century when the Delhi Sultanate was declining were a result of\\nthe rebellions of the governors. The establishment of Vijayanagar and the Bahamani\\nwere a result of the assertion of power by the provincial officers, like Harihara and\\nBukka and Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah respectively. During the same period, Ben-\\n177\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Emergence of Regional States\\ngal in the east and Multan and Sind in the west became independent. Feroz Shah\\nTughlaq tried to regain the lost territories but could not do so. He tried unsuccessfully\\nto take over Bengal. He attacked and plundered Jajnagar (Orissa) but did not annex\\nit. He plundered Kangra and suppressed revolts in Gujarat and Thatta.\\nWith the death of Feroz Shah Tughlaq in 1338, the decline of the Sultanate began. As we\\nhave just mentioned, a large number of local governors became powerful and asserted\\ntheir independence in the provinces. The relationship between the Sultan and the nobles\\nworsened. The conflict with the local rulers and zamindars as well as regional and\\ngeographical tensions weakened the Sultanate further. The declining Sultanate received\\nthe final blow with the invasions of Timur in 1398 AD. Timur was a Turk who had come\\nfrom Central Asia to plunder the wealth of India. Timur entered Delhi and mercilessly\\nkilled both the Hindus and Muslims and massacred women and children as well.\\nFifteen years after the Timur’s raids in Delhi, the Delhi Sultanate declined. The Sul-\\ntanates in Gujarat, Malwa and Jaunpur near Varanasi emerged as powerful regional king-\\ndom. Gujarat and Jaunpur were constantly engaged in tension with the Lodhis of the Delhi\\nSultanate (1451 to 1526 AD). New regional states independent of the Delhi sultanate arose\\nin Central and South India too, out of which the prominent ones were the Gajapatis of Orissa,\\nthe Bahamanis and the Vijayanagara Empire. The Lodhi Sultans like Bahlol Lodhi (1451–\\n1485) and Sikander Lodhi (1489–1526) tried to keep these regional kingdoms under control.\\nFinally, during the rule of Ibrahim Lodhi (1517–1526), Bihar declared its independence. Daulat\\nKhan, the governor of Punjab rebelled and invited Babur to invade India in 1526.\\nWith the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526 AD, and its expansion in the later\\nperiod, the ruling dynasties in the regional states gradually lost their power and these\\nstates over a period of time became the part of the Mughal Empire. But the regional\\nfeatures of language, art, literature and religion continued with changes. With the decline\\nof the Mughals in the eighteenth century, there were rebellions of the provincial governors\\nand a few annexed states declared their independence. As a result new regional king-\\ndoms arose, for instance, Punjab, Bengal, Awadh, Hyderabad, Mysore and the Marathas.\\n INTEXT QUESTION 11.2\\n1.\\n When did decline of Delhi Sultanate began?\\n2.\\n During the rule of Ibrahim Lodhi, which two states declared their independence?\\nHISTORY OF THE REGIONAL STATES: A FEW CASE STUDIES\\n11.3 JAUNPUR:\\nJaunpur is now in Varanasi division in eastern Uttar Pradesh on the banks of river\\nGomati. It was a prosperous province in the eastern part of the Delhi Sultanate. The\\ngovernor of Jaunpur was Malik Sarwar, who was a prominent noble during Feroz\\nShah Tughlaq’s period. In 1394, Sultan Nasiruddin Mohammad Shah Tughlaq made\\nhim a minister and gave him the title of Sultanu-Sharq which means the master of\\nthe east. Thereafter, he was known as Malik Sarwar Sultanus Sharq. After Timur’s\\ninvasion and the weakening of the Delhi Sultanate, Malik Sarwar took advantage of a\\nweak political situation and declared himself independent. Malik Sarwar was\\n178\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEmergence of Regional States\\nsucceeded by his son Mubarak Shah Sharqi. The Sultan struck coins in his name.\\nDuring his period, the ruler of the Delhi sultanate was Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, who tried to\\nannex Jaunpur, but failed. Thereafter, there were constant tensions between the various\\nrulers of Jaunpur and Delhi Sultanate. The Sharqi Sultans made several attempts to con-\\nquer Delhi, but they could never be successful. In 1402, Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, Mubarak\\nShah’s brother became the Sultan and ruled Jaunpur for thirty four years. Ibrahim was\\nalso a scholar, well versed with Islamic theology and law, music and fine arts. He was a\\ngreat patron of architecture. A distinct style of architecture evolved called the Sharqi style\\nthat had some Hindu influence. At its height, the Sharqi Sultanate extended from Aligarh in\\nwestern Uttar Pradesh to Darbhanga in north Bihar in the east and from Nepal in the\\nnorth to Bundelkhand in the south. It was during the reign of Hussain Shah Sharqi (1458–\\n1505) that a prolonged war with Bahlol Lodhi started. Bahlol Lodhi attacked Jaunpur in\\n1484 and Hussain Shah had to flee. Finally, Sikandar Lodhi who succeeded Bahlol Lodhi\\nannexed Jaunpur. Hussain Shah died and the Sharqi dynasty came to an end.\\n11.4 KASHMIR\\nKashmir is in the northern part of India. In the eleventh century, the rulers were followers\\nof Saivism, and Saivism became the central religion in Kashmir. It was a closed kingdom.\\nAlbiruni, the Arab traveller who visited India during this period remarked in his work,\\nAl-Hind that no one, not even Hindus from outside was allowed access to Kashmir. In\\n1320s, the ruling dynasty of Kashmir could not check the devastating Mongol invasions. It\\ntherefore, lost all public support. In 1339, Shamsuddin Shah deposed the Saiva ruler and\\nbecame the ruler of Kashmir. From this period onwards, Islam influenced the Kashmiri\\nsociety. A group of Sufi saints known as the Rishis propagated a religion that combined\\nfeatures of Hinduism and Islam Sufi saints and refugees migrated from Central Asia to\\nKashmir and further influenced the society and religion. Gradually, the poorer section of\\nthe population started converting to Islam. The state encouragement to Islam took place\\nwhen the Kashmiri Sultan, Sikandar Shah (1389–1413), issued an order that all Hindus\\nespecially, the brahmanas living in his kingdom should embrace Islam or leave his king-\\ndom. It is said that these orders were issued at the instance of the king’s minister, Suha\\nBhatt who was a Hindu and had recently converted to Islam.\\nPerhaps, one of the greatest rulers of Kashmir was Zainul Abidin (1420–1470). He was an\\nenlightened ruler and called back those Hindus who had left the state due to the persecution\\nof Sikandar Shah. He abolished jaziya and prohibited cow slaughter and gave the Hindus\\nimportant state posts. A large number of temples were repaired and new ones constructed.\\nAbul Fazl, the court historian of the Mughal Emperor Akbar noted that Kashmir had one\\nhundred and fifty big temples. Sultan Zainul \\nAbidin married the daughters of the Hindu raja of\\nJammu. Some scholars call Zainul Abidin as the Akbar of Kashmir. Under him, Kashmir\\nbecame prosperous and he was called the Bud Shah or the great king of Kashmiris.\\nThe Sultan contributed to the agricultural development of Kashmir by constructing\\ndams and canals. Agricultural records were maintained. During the period of famine\\nand other natural calamities, relief in terms of loans and grains and fodder was pro-\\nvided to the peasants. Sultan also introduced reforms in the currency. He introduced\\nmarket control and fixed prices of the commodities. Traders and merchants were\\nasked to sell the commodities at fixed prices. Sultan also subsidized the import of the\\ncommodities which were scarce in the state. To make up for the shortage of salt, he\\nimported salt from Ladakh and helped the traders in every possible way. Sultan also\\npaid attention to the development of handicrafts. He sent some people to\\n179\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Emergence of Regional States\\nSamarqand for training of paper making and book binding. Sultan also encouraged\\nstone cutting and polishing and many other crafts. He introduced carpet and shawl\\nmaking, which make Kashmir famous till day. Sultan also founded the towns of Zaingir,\\nZainket and Zainpur and laid out the islands on the Dal Lake that can be seen till\\ntoday. His chief engineering achievement was the Zaina Lanka, an artificial island in\\nthe Woolur Lake on which he built his palace and mosque.\\nHe was a great scholar of Persian, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Arab languages and patronised\\nthe Sanskrit and Persian scholars. Under his patronage, the Mahabharat and Kalhana’s\\nRajatarangini were translated into Persian and many Persian and Arabic works were\\ntranslated into Hindi. He himself was a poet and wrote poetry under the pen name ‘Qutb’.\\nAfter him weak rulers ascended the throne of Kashmir and there was confusion.\\nTaking advantage of this, Mirza Haider, Babur’s relative occupied Kashmir. In 1586,\\nAkbar conquered Kashmir and made it a part of the Mughal Empire.\\n11.5 BENGAL\\nBengal was an important regional kingdom under the Palas in the eighth century and\\nthe Senas in the twelfth century. Bengal was the easternmost province of the Delhi\\nSultanate. The long distance, uncomfortable climate and poor means of transport and\\ncommunications made it difficult for the Delhi Sultanate to control this province. There-\\nfore, it was easy for Bengal to assert its independence. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq tried to\\nsolve the problem by partitioning Bengal into three independent administrative divi-\\nsions: Lakhnauti, Satgaon and Sonargaon. However, the problems remained and fi-\\nnally Bengal emerged as an independent regional state in the fourteenth century.\\nIn 1342, one of the nobles, Haji Ilyas Khan united Bengal and became its ruler under\\nthe title of Shamsh-ud-din Iliyas Shah and laid the foundation of the Ilyas Shah dy-\\nnasty. He tried to annex Bengal and raided Orissa and Tirhut and forced them to pay\\ntribute. Such expansions alarmed the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate, who tried to oc-\\ncupy Bengal several times but were not successful. One of the important rulers of the\\nIlyas Shah dynasty was Ghiyasuddin Azam. He was a learned man and promoted\\nPersian literature. He was well known for dispensing free and fair justice to people. It\\nis said that once he killed a son of a widow by accident. The widow filed a complaint\\nwith Qazi who summoned the ruler to the court. When the case was decided, Azam\\ntold the Qazi that had he not discharged his duties honestly he would have killed him.\\nAzam had cordial relations with China. There was a prosperous trading relationship\\nbetween Bengal and China. The port of Chittagaong was an important centre for\\nexchange of goods. On demand from the king of China, Azam also sent Buddhist\\nmonks from Bengal. Pandua and Gaur were the capitals of Bengal.\\nIn 1538, Bengal was annexed by Sher Shah Suri. In 1586, Akbar conquered Bengal, and\\nmade it into a suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali devel-\\noped as a regional language. The establishment of Mughal control over Bengal coin-\\ncided with the rise of agrarian settlements in the forested and marshy areas of south-\\neastern Bengal. Soon after, with the spread of rice cultivation, this area became heavily\\npopulated with the local communities of fisher folks and peasants. The Mughals estab-\\nlished their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries\\nreceived land grants and settled there. Alauddin Hussain Shah (1439 to 1519) was\\nanother important ruler of Bengal. He was very efficient, and gave high administrative\\nposts to the Hindus and is said to have paid respect to Chaitanya of the Vaisnava sect.\\nHe came into conflict with Sikandar Lodhi and had to make peace with him.\\n180\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEmergence of Regional States\\n11.6 GUJARAT\\nThis was a fertile and prosperous province. It had flourishing seaports and was fa-\\nmous for its handicrafts. Alauddin Khalji was the first Sultan to annex it to Delhi\\nSultanate and since then it remained under the Turkish governors of the Sultanate.\\nAfter Timur’s invasion, in 1407, Zafar Khan who was then the governor became the\\nindependent ruler and after sometime assumed the title of Muzaffar Shah. Zafar\\nKhan’s father was a Rajput who had given his sister in marriage to Feroz Shah Tughlaq.\\nAhmad Shah (1411–1441), was one of the important rulers of Gujarat. He founded the\\ncity of Ahmadabad and made it his capital in 1413. He built beautiful buildings, like Jama\\nMasjid and Teen Darwaza and beautified the city with gardens, palaces and bazaars.\\nAhmad Shah was influenced by the Jaina architectural traditions of Gujarat. He was an\\nefficient administrator and consolidated the regional state of Gujarat. He subdued the\\nRajput states, Jhalawar, Bundi and Durgapur. He was supposed to be an orthodox\\nMuslim who imposed jaziya on the Hindus and destroyed several temples. However,\\nthe picture was complex. At the same time, he appointed Hindus to important adminis-\\ntrative positions. Ahmad Shah fought equally fiercely against the Hindu as well as the\\nMuslim rulers. His main enemy were the Muslim rulers of Malwa. The rivalry between\\nGujarat and Malwa was bitter and prevented both the regional states from concentrat-\\ning on larger political gains in north Indian politics. He was famous for imparting justice.\\nHe publicly executed his son-in-law who had murdered an innocent. The author of\\nMirat-i-Ahmadi has rightly said that the impact of this justice lasted till his reign.\\nPerhaps the most important ruler of Gujarat was Mahmud Begarha. He was called\\nMahmud Begarha as he had captured two powerful forts or garh, Girnar (Junagarh)\\nin Saurashtra and the fort of Champaner from the Rajputs in south Gujarat. Both\\nthese forts were of strategic importance. The fort of Girnar was in the prosperous\\nSaurahstra region and also provided a base for operations against Sindh. The Sultan\\nfounded a new town called Mustafabad at the foot of the hill. This town with many\\nbeautiful monuments became the second capital of Gujarat. Similarly, the fort of\\nChampaner was crucial to control Malwa and Khandesh. Mahmud constructed a\\nnew town called Muhammadabad near Champaner.\\nAccording to another version, he was called Begarha as his moustaches resembled the\\nhorns of a cow (begarha). Mahmud is supposed to have had a flowing beard which\\nreached up to his waist. His moustache was supposed to be so long that he tied it over his\\nhead. According to a foreign traveller, Duarto Barbosa, right from his childhood, Mahmud\\nwas given some poison as his food which made him so poisonous that if a fly settled on his\\nhead, it would meet instant death. Mahmud was also famous for huge appetite. It is said\\nthat for breakfast he ate a cup of honey, a cup of butter and one hundred to hundred and\\nfifty banananas. In total, he consumed ten to fifteen kilos of food everyday. Mahmud\\nBegarha ruled for 52 years. He was also a great patron of art and literature. Many\\nworks were translated from Arabic to Persian in his court. His court poet was\\nUdayaraja, who composed poetry in Sanskrit.\\nIn 1507, Mahmud led an expedition against the Portuguese who had settled on the west-\\nern coast and monopolised the trade there, causing immense harm to the Muslim traders.\\nTo break the Portuguese trade monopoly he sought the help of the Sultan of Turkey\\nbut could not get much headway and finally had to give the Portuguese a site for a\\nfactory in Diu. He died in 1511. During the rule of his successors Akbar conquered\\nand annexed Gujarat in 1572 AD.\\n181\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Emergence of Regional States\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 11.3\\n1.\\nTo which areas was Sharqi Sultanate extended?\\n2.\\nWho is referred as Akbar of Kashmir?\\n3.\\nWho laid the foundation of the Ilyas Shah dynasty?\\n4.\\nAhmed Shah founded which city?\\n11.7 THE BAHAMANI SULTANATE\\nIn the fourteenth century two powerful kingdoms arose in South India. One was the\\nBahamani Sultanate and the second kingdom was the Vijayanagar Empire that ruled\\nfor 300 years. In this section we will discuss the history of Bahamani Sultanate and its\\nadministrative features.\\nThe Deccan region was a part of the provincial administration of the Delhi Sultanate.\\nIn order to establish a stable administration in the Deccan, Mohammad bin Tughlaq\\nappointed amiran-i-sada/ Sada Amir, who were the administrative heads of hundred\\nvillages. From 1337 the conflict between the officers in Deccan and Delhi sultanate\\nacclerated. This led to the establishment of an independent state in the Deccan in\\n1347 with the capital at Gulbarga in Andhra Pradesh. Its founders Haran Kangu\\nassumed the title Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah as he traced his descent from the\\nmythical hero of Iran, Bahman Shah and the kingdom was named after him, the\\nBahamani Sultanate. After Mohammad bin Tughlaq there were no attempts by the\\nDelhi Sultanate to control the Deccan region. Therefore, the Bahamani Sultans with-\\nout any checks annexed the kingdom. One of the important acquisitions was the\\ncontrol over Dabhol, an important port on the west coast.\\nUnder Bahman Shah and his son Muhammmad Shah, the administrative system\\nwas well organised. The kingdom was divided into four administrative units called\\n‘taraf’ or provinces. These provinces were Daultabad, Bidar, Berar and Gulbarga.\\nMuhammad I defeated the Vijayanagar kingdom and consequently Golconda was\\nannexed to Bahamani kingdom. Every province was under a tarafdar who was\\nalso called a subedar. Some land was converted into Khalisa land from the\\njurisdiction of the tarafdar. Khalisa land was that piece of land which was used\\nto run expenses of the king and the royal household. Further the services and the\\nsalary of every noble was fixed. Those nobles who kept 500 horses were given\\n1000,000 huns annually. If short of the stipulated troops, the tarafdar would\\nhave to reimburse the amount to the central government. Nobles used to get their\\nsalary either in cash or in form of grant of land or ‘jagir’ Bahamani ruler de-\\npended for military support on his amirs. There were two groups in the ranks of\\namirs: One was the Deccanis who were immigrant Muslims and had been stay-\\ning for a long time in the Deccan region. The other group was Afaquis or Pardesis\\nwho had recently come from Central Asia, Iran and Iraq and had settled in the\\n182\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEmergence of Regional States\\nDeccan region recently. Between both these groups there was always tension to\\nappropriate better administrative positions. Because of their feuds, the stability\\nof the Bahamani Sultanate was affected. For the first time in India both these\\nkingdoms used gunpowder in the warfare. The Bahamanis were already familiar\\nwith the use of firearms. They employed Turkish and Portuguese experts to train\\nthe soldiers in the latest weaponry of warfare.\\nOne of the most important personalities in the Bahamani kingdom was Mahmud Gawan.\\nMahmud Gawan’s early life is obscure. He was an Iranian by birth and first reached\\nDeccan as a trader. He was granted the title of ‘Chief of the Merchants’ or Malik-\\nut-Tujjar by the Bahamani ruler, Humayun Shah. The sudden death of Humayun led\\nto the coronation of his minor son Ahmad III. A regency council was set for the\\nadministration and Mahmud Gawan was its important member. He was made wazir\\nor the prime minister and was given the title of ‘Khwaju-i-Jahan.’ The history of\\nBahmani kingdom after this period is actually the record of the achievements of\\nMahmud Gawan. Despite of being an Afaqui he was liberal and wanted a compro-\\nmise between the Afaquis and the Deccanis. He controlled the kingdom in an effi-\\ncient manner and provided it stability. Gawan conquered the Vijayanagar territories\\nup to Kanchi. On the western coast, Goa and Dhabol were conquered. Losing these\\nimportant ports was a great loss for Vijayanagar. Bahamani strengthened its trading\\nrelations with Iran and Iraq after gaining control over Goa and Dabhol.\\nGawan carried out many internal reforms and attempted to put an end to the strife in\\nthe nobility. In order to curb the military power of the tarafdar, Gawan ordered that\\nonly one fort of each province was to be under the direct control of the provincial\\ntarafdar. The remaining forts of the province were placed under a Qiladar or com-\\nmander of the forts. The Qiladar was appointed by the central Government. How-\\never, soon after his death, the governors declared their independence and the Bahamani\\nkingdom broke up. In the fifteenth and the sixteenth century, some amirs in Bidar,\\nAhmadnagar, Golconda and Bijapur and Berar established independent sultanates of\\ntheir own and formed new states. These were the Nizam Shahis of Ahmadnagar, the\\nAdil Shahis of Bijapur, the Qutb Shahis of Golconda, and the Imad Shahis of Berar\\nand the Barid Shahis of Bidar. They formed a league of states and strengthened them\\nby matrimonial alliances. They maintained the traditional rivalry with the Vijayanagar\\nrulers. Golconda and Bijapur entered into matrimonial alliances and led the Battle of\\nTalikota against Vijayanagar. They finally succumbed to the Mughal armies.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 11.4\\n1.\\nWho appointed Sada Amir and for which region?\\n2.\\nWho was Mahmud Gawan?\\n11.8 THE VIJAYANAGAR EMPIRE\\nA Political History\\nIn 1336, Vijayanagar kingdom was established by Harihara and Bukka, who were two\\nbrothers and served in the army of Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq. They broke away from the\\nDelhi Sultanate and established an independent state in Karnataka and established the\\n183\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Emergence of Regional States\\ncapital city Vijayanagar on the banks of river Tungabhadra in 1336. Their dynasty was\\ncalled the Sangama dynasty. There are several theories with regard to the origin of this\\ndynasty. According to some scholars, they had been the feudatories of the Kakatiyas of\\nWarangal and after their fall they served the Kampili state. Another view says that they\\nwere the feudatories of the Hoysalas and belonged to Karnataka. Harihara and Bukka\\nwere helped and inspired by contemporary scholar and a saint Vidyaranya for the establish-\\nment of their kingdom. It is believed that to commemorate the memory of their guru, the\\nbrothers established the city of Vidyanagar or Vijayanagara on the banks of river Tungabhadra.\\nThe empire included people from different cultural regions, the Tamil, Telegu and Karnataka\\nregion who all spoke different languages and belonged to different cultures.\\nBetween 1336 and 1565, Vijayanagar was ruled by three different dynasties- Sangama,\\nwho remained in power till 1485; the Saluva who remained in power till 1503 and the\\nTuluvas. The last dynasty was the Aravidu dynasty that ruled till seventeenth century.\\nForeign travellers like Nicolo Conti, Fernao Nuniz ,Domingo Paes, Duarto Barbosa\\nand Abdur Razzaq wrote about the magnificence of Vijayanagar.\\nOne of the most important rulers of the Vijayanagar states was Krishnadevaraya, the\\nfounder of the Tuluva dynasty. He was a great commander and an efficient adminis-\\ntrator. He fought a series of war with the independent kingdoms that came on the\\nruins of the Bahamani kingdom, maintained law and order and dealt with the Portu-\\nguese influence in the Deccan. He completely shattered the Adil Shahi forces of\\nBijapur first and attacked Gulbarga and set free three Bahamani princes who were\\nimprisoned there. He helped them in recovering the throne of Gulbarga and Krishna\\nDeva himself took the title of Yavanarajya sthapanacharya.\\nKrishnadevaraya built some fine stone temples and added impressive gopurams or gate-\\nways to many important South Indian temples. He also founded a suburban township near\\nVijayanagara called Nagalapuram after his mother. Some of the most detailed descrip-\\ntions of Vijayanagar come from his period. The famous temple of Tirupati developed\\nduring his period greatly as the deity there was his titular deity. After Krishna Deva Raya,\\nhis brother Achyuta Deva Raya ascended the throne in 1530 AD, who was also an\\nimportant ruler. During his reign the rival groups began to make his appearance. The\\nstruggle for power was mainly between Saluva Vira Narasimha and Aravidu Rama Raya,\\nin which the later emerged victorious. Although Rama Raya did not assume the throne,\\nyet he placed Sadasiva Raya on the throne and ruled as the defacto ruler. He removed the\\nold nobility and replaced it with those loyal to him. Rama Raya tried to balance the Deccan\\npowers by playing one against the other, such a policy could not continue for a long period.\\nThe Deccan states formed a confederacy and inflicted a crushing blow on the Vijayanagar\\narmies in the battle of Talikota. Rama Raya was killed. The Deccani armies entered\\nVijayanagar and reduced in into ruins. Now the focus shifted to the east where the Aravidu\\ndynasty ruled from Penukonda and later from Chandragiri (near Tirupati).\\nArmy and Military Organisation Of The Vijayanagar Empire\\nIn order to wage continuous warfare there was a need to keep a large army. Artillery\\nwas important and well bred horses were maintained. The Vijayanagar rulers im-\\nported high quality horses from across the Arabian Sea from Arabia and other Gulf\\ncountries. The port of Malabar was the centre of this trade and trade in other luxury\\ncommodities. The Vijayanagar rulers always attempted to control the port of Malabar.\\nLike the Bahamanis, the Vijayanagar state also was familiar with the use of firearms\\nand employed Turkish and Portuguese experts to train the soldiers in the latest\\nweaponry of warfare. One of the rayas, Deva Raya II enrolled Muslims in his armed\\n184\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEmergence of Regional States\\nservices, allotted them jagirs and erected a mosque for their use in the city. Such\\nnew techniques in warfare now revolutionised the warfare. The walls of the forts to\\ncounter the firearms were now made thick and special kinds of door with fortified\\nwalls front were constructed. On the walls of the forts, special kinds of big holes\\nwere made to rest the guns. Special kinds of parapets were constructed on the forts\\nto put the canons on it. Firearms were used. Some firearms were small and com-\\nprised of rifles and pistols. Some like canons were heavy and had to be put on a\\nbullock cart or on an elephant and pushed into the battlefield.\\nOne of the important characteristics of the Vijayanagar administration was the amara-\\nnayaka system. In this system, the commander of the Vijayanagar army was called\\nthe nayaka. Each nayaka was given an area for administration. The nayaka was\\nresponsible for expanding agricultural activities in his area. He collected taxes in his\\narea and with this income maintained his army, horses, elephants and weapons of\\nwarfare that he had to supply to the raya or the Vijayanagar ruler. The nayaka was\\nalso the commander of the forts. Some of the revenue was also used for the mainte-\\nnance of temples and irrigation works. The amara-nayakas sent tribute to the king\\nannually and personally appeared in the royal court with gifts to express their loyalty.\\nIn the seventeenth century, several of these nayakas became independent and estab-\\nlished separate states. The feudal Nayankaras used to maintain their own soldiers,\\nforces and elephants. They were a powerful section that challenged the Vijayanagar\\nauthority, weakened its Internal structures and contributed to the defeat of the\\nVijayangar in the battle of Talikota.\\n11.8.2 CONFLICT BETWEEN THE VIJAYANAGAR\\nAND THE BAHAMANIS\\nThere were constant conflicts between the Vijayanagar and the Bahamani king-\\ndoms over the control of Raichur doab which was the land between rivers Krishna\\nand Tungabhadra. This area was fertile and rich in mineral resources. The famous\\ndiamond mines of Golconda were located in the eastern part of the doab region.\\nThe geography of both the kingdoms was such that expansion was possible only\\nacross Tungabhadra in the Deccan. It appears that the battles between the two\\nwere not conclusive and the status quo was maintained. Sometimes, Bahamani\\nhad an advantage and sometimes, Vijayanagar had an advantage. For instance, in\\n1504, the Bahamani managed to reconquer the Raichur doab. However, with the\\nascent of Krishna Deva Raya, the Bahamanis lost Raichur, Mudkal, Nalgonda and\\nother inland towns. An important result of these wars was that both the powers\\nwere so involved amongst themselves that they never realised the increasing power\\nof the Portuguese on the coast of South India. Besides, continuous warfare ex-\\nhausted the resources of both the states and weakened them.\\nThe other areas of conflict were the Marathwada region and the deltaic region of\\nKrishna-Godavari. Both regions had fertile areas and important ports that controlled\\ntrade to the foreign countries. For instance, the fertile area in the Marathwada region\\nwas the Konkan belt that also had the port of Goa which was an important region for\\ntrade and export and import especially import of horses from Iraq and Iran.\\nOften, the battles between the Vijayanagar and the Bahamani states are perceived as\\nHindu-Muslim conflicts. The above reasons show that the struggle was not due to\\nany religious differences. Territorial and economic motives were the main causes for\\nthe war. Despite hostilities between the two states, there were times when they also\\nco-operated with each other. Krishnadevaraya, for example, supported some claim-\\n185\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Emergence of Regional States\\nants to power in the Sultanates and took pride in the title “establisher of the Yavana\\nkingdom”. Similarly, the Sultan of Bijapur intervened to resolve succession disputes in\\nVijayanagra following the death of Krishnadevaraya.

As the Mughal authority weak-\\nened, the governors of the provinces, subedars, and the big zamindars became pow-\\nerful and asserted their independence.\\nThe regional states of this period can be divided into three categories:\\n1.\\nThere were some states whose founders were important Mughal nobles and held\\nhigh mansabs. Though they became independent, they never broke fromal ties\\nwith the Mughal state. Some of the important states in this category are Awadh,\\nBengal and Hyderabad. The founder of the Awadh state was Sa’adat Khan. The\\nfounder of Bengal was Mushid Quli Khan and the founder of Hyderabad state\\nwas Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. All three were powerful members of the Mughal\\nnobility and were the governors of these provinces. As the Mughal Empire weak-\\nened, there was a large-scale migration of soldiers and administrators from Delhi\\nto these new states that promised numerous opportunities.\\nIn these states the position of the previous zamindars changed. For example,\\nSa’adat Khan seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fer-\\ntile lands of the Afghans at Rohilkhand. Similarly, in an effort to reduce Mughal\\ninfluence in Bengal, Mushid Quli Khan transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa\\nand ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was\\ncollected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many\\nzamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those un-\\nable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars.\\nAnother change in these states was the rise of the bankers and moneylend-\\ners or mahajans. The state and the landed class depended on them for\\nloans. These bankers in turn became powerful and influenced the adminis-\\ntration. The state auctioned its right to collect taxes to the highest bidders,\\nwho were usually bankers and mahajans. In turn, the bankers promised to\\n186\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEmergence of Regional States\\npay a fixed sum of money to the state. Thus, the state was assured of a fixed\\nincome. This system was called the ijaradari system and those who bought\\nthe right to collect taxes were known as ijaredars. The Mughal state had\\nalways discouraged this system. There were chances that those who col-\\nlected the tax would collect much more than fixed, exploiting the peasants\\nand would give less to the state thereby causing a loss to the state revenue.\\n2.\\nThe second category of regional states in the eighteenth century was those states\\nthat had already enjoyed a lot of independence during the Mughal rule as watan\\njagirs. The Rajput states belonged to this category.\\n3.\\nThe third category of regional states was those that had emerged after rebelling\\nagainst the Mughal authority. The Sikhs, the Marathas and the Jats belonged to\\nthis group. For example, the Sikh rebellion against the Mughals led to state-\\nbuilding in the Punjab.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 11.6\\n1.\\nRegional States in 18th century have been divided into which categories?\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nThe rise of regional states from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century is due to\\ninternal weakness of Delhi Sultanate and decline of Mughal Empire. An under-\\nstanding of the nature of these regional powers will help you see the Delhi sul-\\ntanate and Mughal Empire in a clear perspective. It will be useful if the regional\\nstates of this period are seen in continuation with the regional states from sixth to\\nthe twelfth century also.

There were a large number of such states but we\\nhave taken only a few as case studies. Jaunpur, Kashmir, Gujarat, Bengal,\\nVijayanagr and Bahamani were discussed. It should be remembered that though\\nthese states fought with each other, but they also borrowed ideas in the field of\\nart, architecture and religion from each other.

Some new institutions were\\nalso introduced. After the coming of the Mughals some of these underwent changes\\nand a few new ones got introduced. A few of the administrative institution had their\\nroots in Arab and Central Asia from where the new ruling group came. While some\\nothers were of Indian origin. A significant feature of these was that many of these got\\ntransformed and in due course of time developed as suitable to Indian context.\\nThe new administrative system and institutions contributed in the consolidation of the\\nSultanate and Mughal empire. It would not be possible for us to discuss all aspects of\\nadministration over a period of 500 years in a small lesson. However we will try to\\nprovide the basic features, continuity and changes in the administrative structure and\\nsome important institutions.\\nThe ruling class kept changing during this period. These institutions were used by various\\nrulers for other purposes also. The rulers from time to time included people from various\\nsocial classes in the administrative apparatus in order to have social harmony. It was\\nnatural on the part of these social classes to stake a claim in the system of governance\\nand various rulers readily accommodated them in this system. In this sense these institu-\\ntions also emerged as a tool to contain any kind of social conflict in the society, though\\nthere were various other measures also that were used by the rulers for this purpose.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to:\\n \\nknow about the nature and composition of Sultanate and Mughal ruling class;\\n \\nunderstand the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate;\\n \\nrecall the main administrative departments of the Sultanate period;\\n \\ndescribe the provincial and local administration under the Sultans;\\n \\ndiscuss the main features of the iqta system;\\n \\nanalyse the market control policy of Alauddin Khalji;\\n \\nknow about the central and provincial administration of the Mughals;\\n \\ndiscuss main features of jagir system;\\n \\ntrace the evolution of Mansabdari system and\\n \\nunderstand administrative structure under the Marathas.\\n190\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nAdministrative System and Institutions\\n12.1 EVOLUTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE\\nUNDER DELHI SULTANATE\\nWhen Qutubuddin Aibak established himself as an independent Sultan at Lahore, the\\navailable administrative apparatus was continued in the initial phase. The prevailing\\nstructure was not altered or disturbed and as long, as the local rulers recognised the\\nsupremacy of the Sultan in Delhi, they were allowed to collect taxes and send it to the\\ncentral treasury as tribute. The central officials in these areas were mainly to help\\nthe local rulers in their administrative tasks. With the expansion and consolidation of the\\nDelhi Sultanate, new administrative institutions also started emerging. The administra-\\ntive structures and institutions introduced in India were influenced by the Mongols,\\nSeljukids etc, brought by the new rulers. The existing administrative institutions in dif-\\nferent parts of the country also contributed in giving shape to the new system.\\nThe Sultans were aware of the fact that they had to rule over a subject population\\nthat was largely non-Islamic. Thus the Sultans of Delhi had to introduce particular mea-\\nsures to suit the prevailing conditions in the Sultanate. From the administrative point of\\nview, the local level administration, it seems, was left mainly in the hands of village head-\\nmen etc. The large extent of the Sultanate necessitated the evolution of administrative\\nstructure separately for the centre and provinces. Thus, during the Sultanate period, ad-\\nministrative institutions emerged at different levels - central, provincial and local.\\nLet us now examine various components of the administrative system in detail.\\n12.2 ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM\\nDuring the Sultanate period the administrative apparatus was headed by the Sultan\\nwho was helped by various nobles. There were various other offices along with the\\noffice of the Sultan. Theoretically, there was a council of Ministers Majlis-i-Khalwat\\nto assist the Sultan.\\n(i)\\nThe Sultan\\nThe Sultan was the central figure in the administrative set up. He was the head of the\\ncivil administration and Supreme Commander of the army. He made all the appoint-\\nments and promotions. He also had the right to remove anybody from the service. He\\nhad absolute power in his hand. He was also the head of the Judiciary. He used to\\nconfer titles and honours upon people. Theoretically the Sultan had an exalted position but\\nin actual practice different Sultans enjoyed varying power. The position of the Sultan was\\nalways under pressure from the powerful group of nobility and Ulema. Sultans of Delhi,\\nparticularly the powerful Sultans, adopted various strategies to keep these groups under\\ncontrol. Balban kept the nobles firmly under his control. Thus the personality of the Sultan\\nplayed a significant role in the administrative structure of the Sultanate. Under the capable\\nand strong Sultans, the administration and the administrative structure functioned well but\\nunder the inefficient and weak ruler the same was under pressure.\\n(ii)\\nNobility\\nThe nobles were the most important functionaries of the state and enjoyed high social\\nstatus. In the initial stage they were those commanders who came with the victorious\\narmy. Over a period of time their descendants formed the main strength and some Indian\\ngroups also emerged. The position and power of the nobility varied from time to time as\\nhas been mentioned above. Nobles, particularly those who were based at Delhi, emerged\\nas a very powerful group and at times even played a role in the selection of the sultan.\\n191\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\nThe nobility was not a homogeneous class. There were different groups within the nobility\\nand often there were inter group clashes and rivalries. The clash between Turkish and\\nTajik nobles started during the time of Iltutmish and became intense after his death.\\nThe group of chahalgan (group of 40 nobles), which was created by Iltutmish, also\\nemerged very powerful.\\nBalban was the first Sultan to bring the nobility firmly under his control (interestingly,\\nhe had been a part of chalalgan earlier). Qutubuddin Aibak and Iltutmish had consid-\\nered the nobles at par with themselves. Balban maintained distance from the nobility\\nand enforced strict code of conduct for himself and for the nobility. No loose talk or\\nlaughter was allowed in the court. He also emphasized on high blood and made it a\\ncriteria for occupying high positions and offices.\\nWith the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate there were also attempts on the part of\\ndifferent sections of the society to join the nobility. Initially it was the preserve of the\\nTurks only. During the rule of the Khalji and Tughlags the doors of the nobility were\\nopened to people of diverse backgrounds. The low caste people, both Hindus and\\nMuslims, joined the nobility and could rise to high positions especially under Muhammad\\nBin Tughlaq. During the Lodi period the Afghan concept of equality became impor-\\ntant when the Sultan was considered “first among equals”. Thus the nobles enjoyed\\nequal status with the Sultan. Some of the Lodi Sultans like Sikandar Lodi and Ibrahim\\nLodi found this uncomfortable and tried to bring the nobles under their control. The\\nnobles resisted this which resulted in the trouble for both the Sultans.\\n (iii) Ulema\\nThe religious intellectual group of Muslims was collectively referred as Ulema. People\\nof this group managed religious matters and interpreted religious regulations for Sul-\\ntan. They were also incharge of judicial matters and worked as Qazis at various\\nlevels. It was quite influential group and commanded respect of Sultan and nobility.\\nThey also had influence among Muslim masses. This group used to pressurize the\\nsultan to run the Sultanate as per the religious laws of Islam. The Sultan and nobles\\ngenerally tried to run the administrative affairs as per the need of state rather than\\nreligious laws. Sultan like Alauddin Khalji could ignore the opinions of Ulema on a\\nnumber of issues but some followed their line.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 12.1\\n1.\\nWhat was Chalalgan and who created it .\\n2.\\nWho was the first Sultan to bring the nobility firmly under the control of the\\nSultan for the first time?\\n3.\\nWhat was the position of the Sultan vis-à-vis the nobility according to the Afghan\\nconcept of sovereignty?\\n4.\\nWho were Ulema ?\\n192\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nAdministrative System and Institutions\\n12.3 CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION\\nAs already mentioned the administrative system was headed by the Sultan. There\\nwere a number of departments which were assigned different responsibilities. These\\ndepartments were managed by influential nobles. We will provide a brief account of a\\nfew departments.\\n(i)\\nWizarat\\nAfter Sultan, the most important office was the Diwan-i-Wizarat, headed by the\\nwazir. It was a key position in the royal court and his role was of a general supervisor\\nover all departments, though he was one of the four important departmental heads.\\nHe was the chief advisor to the Sultan. The main functions of the wazir were to look\\nafter the financial organization of the State, give advice to the Sultan, and on occa-\\nsions to lead military expeditions at Sultan’s behest. He also supervised the payment\\nto the army. The wizarat or the office of wazir also kept a check on land revenue\\ncollections, maintained a record of all the income and expenditure incurred by the\\nstate and thus controlled or recorded the salaries of all royal servants, handled the\\ncharitable donations such as Waqfs, Inams etc. Further, the Mints, the intelligence\\ndepartments, the royal buildings and other bodies affiliated to the royal court were\\nsupervised by the wizarat. The wazir had direct access to the Sultan and it was on his\\nwisdom, sincerity and loyalty that the position of the Sultan depended greatly.\\nThere were several other departments which worked under the wizarat. They were\\nentrusted with specific functions. These included Mustaufi-i-Mumalik (Auditor Gen-\\neral), Mushrif-i-Mumalik (Accountant General), Majmuadar (Keeper of loans and\\nbalances from treasury). Later some other offices were brought under the supervi-\\nsion of the Wizarat like Diwan-i -Waqoof (to supervise expenditure), Diwan-i-\\nMustakharaj (to look into the arrears of revenue payments), Diwan-i-Amir Kohi (to\\nbring uncultivated land into cultivation through state support).\\n(ii)\\nDiwan-i-Arz\\nThis department was set up to look after the military organization of the empire. It was\\nheaded by Ariz-i-Mumalik. He was responsible for the administration of military af-\\nfairs. He maintained royal contingent, recruited the soldiers, ensured the discipline and\\nfitness of the army, inspected the troops maintained by the Iqta-holders, examined the\\nhorses and branded them with the royal insignia. During times of war, the ariz arranged\\nmilitary provisions, transportation and administered the army at war, provided constant\\nsupplies and was the custodian of the war booty. Alauddin Khalji introduced the system\\nof Dagh (branding) and huliya (description) and cash payment to the soldiers in order\\nto strengthen his control over the army. The contingent stationed at Delhi was called\\nhasham-i-qalb and Provincial contingents were called hasham-i-atraf.\\n(iii)\\nDiwan-i-Insha\\nThis department looked after the state correspondence. It was headed by Dabir-i-\\nKhas. He drafted and despatched royal orders and received reports from various\\nofficers. The Dabir was the formal channel of communication between the centre\\nand other regions of the empire. He was also a sort of private secretary of the Sultan\\nand was responsible for writing the farmans.\\nThe Barid-i-Mumalik was the head of the state news gathering and dealt with intel-\\nligence. He had to keep information of all that was happening in the Sultanate. At\\nlocal level there were barids who used to send regular news concerning the matters\\n193\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\nof the state to the central office. Apart from barids, another set of reporters also\\nexisted who were known as Munihiyan.\\n(iv)\\nDiwan-i-Rasalat\\nThis department dealt with the administration of Justice. It was headed by Sadr-us-\\nSadr who was also the qazi-i-mumalik. He was the highest religious officer and took\\ncare of ecclesiastical affairs. He also appointed the qazis (judges) and approved\\nvarious charitable grants like waqf, wazifa, Idrar, etc.\\nThe Sultan was the highest court of appeal in both civil and criminal matters. Next to\\nhim was Qazi-i-mumalik. The Muhtasibs (Public Censors) assisted the judicial de-\\npartment. Their main task was to see that there was no public infringement of the\\ntenets of Islam. He was also to supervise and enforce the public morals and conduct.\\n(v)\\nOther Departments\\nApart from these, there were a number of smaller departments at the centre which\\nhelped in the everyday administration of the empire. Wakil-i-dar looked after the\\nroyal household and managed the personal services of the Sultan. Amir-i-Hajib looked\\nafter the royal ceremonies. He used to act as an intermediary between the Sultan and\\nsubordinate officials and between Sultan and the public. Sar-i-Jandar looked after\\nthe royal body guards. Amir-i-Akhur looked after the establishment of horses and\\nShahnah-i-fil looked after the establishment of elephants. Amir-i-Majlis looked af-\\nter the arrangement of meetings and special ceremonies. The Royal workshops\\n(Karkhanas) played an important role in the administrative system of the Sultanate.\\nThe needs of the royal household were met through Karkhanas. The Karkhanas were\\nof two types - (i) Manufactories (ii) Store House. Under Feroz Tughlaq, there were as\\nmany as 36 Karkhanas. Each Karkhana was supervised by a noble who had the rank\\nof a Malik or a Khan. The Mutasarrif was responsible for the accounts and acted as\\nimmediate supervisors in various departments.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 12.2\\n1.\\nMention two departments that worked under the Wizarat.\\n2.\\nWhat practices did Alauddin Khalji introduce in the army?\\n3.\\nWhich department dealt with the administration of Justice and who headed it?\\n12.4 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION AND IQTA SYSTEM\\nThe administration in the areas that were outside the core political area was carried\\nout in a number of ways. It depended on the degree of political control which was\\nexercised over the areas. The territorial expansion and consolidation of the sultanate\\nwas a process which continued throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. Some of the\\nnewly conquered areas were brought directly under the control of the Sultanate and\\nsome other areas remained semi autonomous. Thus different Control mechanisms\\nwere adopted by the Sultan for these areas. In the areas that were loosely affiliated to\\nthe Sultanate, a few officials were appointed by the Centre as a symbol of imperial\\npresence but everyday administration remained in local hands. The interest of the\\ncentre in these areas was mostly economic, i.e. the collection of the revenue.\\n194\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nAdministrative System and Institutions\\nThe provinces were placed under the charge of the Governors who were respon-\\nsible for the overall administration of the area. This involved ensuring the collection\\nof revenue, maintaining law and order and keeping rebellious elements under con-\\ntrol. He was a deputy of the Sultan in his area. Since the officials were frequently\\ntransferred and not familiar with the areas, they were generally dependent on local\\nofficials to perform their duties. The collection of the revenue was not possible\\nwithout the help of the local officials. Thus the governor and the local power blocs\\nworked in close association with each other. At times the combination created prob-\\nlems for the Sultan as the governors used to become powerful with the help provided\\nby the local rulers and rise in rebellion against the Sultan. During the 14th century the\\nprovinces were partitioned into Shiqs for administrative convenience. The shiqs\\nwere administered by the Shiqdar. Subsequently the Shiqs got transformed into\\nSarkar during the Afghan period. Faujdar was another officer along with Shiqdar\\nat the provincial level. Their duties are not clearly articulated, and often the role of\\nthe two seem to overlap. The Shiqdar assisted the governor in the maintenance of\\nlaw and order and provided military assistance. He also supervised the functioning\\nof the smaller administrative units. The duties of the Faujdar were similar to the\\nShiqdar. The Kotwals were placed under the Faujdar.\\nThe other important officers at the provincial level were Barids (intelligence officer\\nand reporter) and Sahib-i-Diwan (who maintained the financial accounts of the\\nprovincial income and expenditure).\\n12.5 IQTA SYSTEM\\nThe institution of the Iqta had been in force in early Islamic world as a form of\\nreward for services to the state. In the caliphate administration it was used to pay\\ncivil and military officers. After the establishment of the Sultanate iqta system was\\nintroduced by the Sultans. To begin with the army commanders and nobles were\\ngiven territories to administer and collect the revenue. The territories thus assigned\\nwere called iqta and their holders as iqtadar or muqti.\\nIn essence this was a system of payment to the officers and maintenance of army by\\nthem. Gradually rules and regulations were laid down to organize the whole system.\\nThrough the years it became the main instrument of administrating the Sultanate.\\nFurther the sultans could get a large share of the surplus production from different\\nparts of the vast territories through this system.\\nFrom the 14th century we hear of Walis or muqtis who are commanders of military\\nand administrative tracts called Iqta. Their exact powers varied according to circum-\\nstances. In due course the muqti was given complete charge of the administration of\\nthe iqta which included the task of maintaining an army. The muqti was to help the\\nsultan with his army in case of need. He was expected to maintain the army and\\nmeet his own expenses with the revenue collected. From the time of Balban the\\nmuqti was expected to send the balance (fawazil) of the income to the centre after\\nmeeting his and the army’s expenses. This means that the central revenue depart-\\nment had made an assessment of the expected income of the Iqta, the cost of the\\nmaintenance of the army and the muqti’s own expenses. This process became even\\nmore strict during the time of Alauddhin Khalji. As the central control grew, the\\ncontrol over muqti’s administration also increased. The Khwaja (probably same as\\nSahib-i-Diwan) was appointed to keep a record of the income of the Iqtas. It was\\non the basis of this record that the Sultan used to make his revenue demands. A barid\\n195\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\nor intelligence officer was also appointed to keep the Sultan informed. During the reign\\nof Muhmmad-bin-Thughlaq a number of governors were appointed on revenue sharing\\nterms where they were to give a fixed sum to the state. During the time of Feroze Shah\\nTughlaq the control of state over iqtas was diluted when iqtas became hereditary.\\n12.6 LOCAL ADMINISTRATION\\nThe village was the smallest unit of administration. The functioning and administration of\\nthe village remained more or less the same as it had existed in pre Turkish times. The main\\nvillage functionaries were khut, Muqaddam and Patwari. They worked in close coordi-\\nnation with the muqti in the collection of revenue and in maintaining law and order etc. A\\nnumber of villages formed the Pargana. The important Pargana officials were Chaudhary,\\nAmil (revenue collector) and Karkun (accountant). Village and pargana were indepen-\\ndent units of administration, and yet there were inter related areas. In certain cases the\\nprovince had a local ruler (Rai, Rana, Rawat, Raja) who helped the governor in his\\nduties. In such cases the local rulers were recognised as subordinates of the Sultan.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 12.3\\n1.\\nName three officials at the level of pargana.\\n2.\\nMention some of the administrative units of the Sultanate period.\\n3.\\nMention a few important village functionaries.\\n4.\\nWhat was Fawazil?\\n12.7 MARKET REFORMS OF ALAUDDIN KHALJI\\nThe market reforms of Alauddin Khalji were oriented towards administrative and military\\nnecessities. Medieval rulers believed that necessities of life, especially food grains, should\\nbe available to the city folk at reasonable prices. But few rulers had been able to control\\nthe prices for any length of time. Alauddin Khalji was more or less the first ruler who\\nlooked at the problem of price control, in a systematic manner and was able to maintain\\nstable prices for a considerable period. It has been pointed out that Alauddin Khalji insti-\\ntuted the market control because after the mongol seige of Delhi, he wanted to recruit a\\nlarge army. All his treasures would have soon exhausted if he was to spend huge re-\\nsources on army. With low prices the sultan could recruit a large army with low expenses.\\nWhatever may be the reason for the market reforms, elaborate administrative arrange-\\nments were made to ensure that the market control was followed strictly.\\nAlauddin fixed the prices of all commodities from grain to cloth, slaves, cattles\\netc. He also set up three markets at Delhi, the first for food grains, the second\\nfor cloth of all kinds and for expensive items such as sugar, ghee, oil, dry fruits\\netc. and the third for the horses, slaves and cattle. For controlling the food prices,\\nAlauddin tried to control not only the supply of food grains from the villages, and\\nits transportation to the city by the grain merchants, but also its proper distribu-\\ntion to the citizens. A number of measures were taken to see that prices laid\\n196\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nAdministrative System and Institutions\\ndown by the Sultan were strictly observed. An officer (Shehna) was in charge\\nof the market to see that no one violates the royal orders. Barids (intelligence\\nofficers ) and munhiyan (secret spies) were also appointed. Alauddin also tried\\nto ensure that there were sufficient stocks of food-grains with the government\\nso that the traders did not hike up prices by creating an artificial scarcity, or\\nindulge in profiterring. Granaries were set up in Delhi and Chhain (Rajasthan).\\nThe Banjaras or Karwaniyan who transported the food grains from the country\\nside to the city were asked to form themselves in a body. They were to settle on\\nthe banks of Yamuna with their families. An official (Shehna) was appointed to\\noversee them. To ensure the regular supply of food grains to the Banjaras, a\\nnumber of regulations were made. All the food grains were to be brought to the\\nmarket (mandis) and sold only at official prices.\\nThe second market for cloth, dry fruits, ghee etc. was called Sarai-i- adl. All the\\nclothes brought from different parts of the country and also from outside were to\\nbe stored and sold only in this market at government rates. To ensure an ad-\\nequate supply of all the commodities, all the merchants were registered and a\\ndeed taken from them that they would bring the specified quantities of commodi-\\nties to the Sarai-i-adl every year. The Merchants who, brought commodities\\nfrom long distances including foreign countries were given advance money on\\nthe condition that they would not sell to any intermediaries. In cases of costly\\ncommodities an officer was to issue permits to amirs, maliks etc. for the pur-\\nchase of these expensive commodities in accordance with their income. This\\nwas done to prevent any black marketing of these expensive products.\\nThe third market dealt with horses, cattle and slaves. The supply of horses of good\\nquality at fair prices was important for the army. Alauddin did away with the middle-\\nman or dallal who had become very powerful. It was decided that the government\\nfixed the Quality and prices of the horses. Similarly, the prices of slave boys and girls\\nand of cattle were also fixed. But these reforms didn’t last long and after the death of\\nAlauddin these reforms got lost.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 12.4\\n1.\\nWho were the officials to look after market regulation ?\\n2.\\nName the places at which the granaries were set up by Alauddin Khalji.\\n3.\\nWho were Banjaras?\\n12.8 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE UNDER THE MUGHALS\\nThe Mughals retained many features of the administrative system of the Sultanate\\nand Shershah. Under Shershah the administrative units of Pargana (a group of vil-\\nlages), sarkar (a group of parganas) and groups of sarkars (some what like subas or\\nprovince) were placed under specific offices. The Mughals formalized a new territo-\\nrial unit called suba. Institutions of Jagir and Mansab system were also introduced by\\nthe Mughals. Thus change and continuity both marked the Mughal administrative\\nstructure which brought about a high degree of centralisation in the system.\\n197\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\n12.8.1 CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION\\n(i)\\nThe Emperor\\nThe Emperor was the supreme head of the administration and controlled all military\\nand judicial powers. All officers in Mughal administration owed their power and posi-\\ntion to the Emperor. The Emperor had authority to appoint, promote, and remove\\nofficials at his pleasure. There was no pressure institutional or otherwise on the Em-\\nperor. For smooth functioning of the empire a few departments were created.\\n(ii)\\nWakil and Wazir\\nThe institution of Wizarat (or Wikalat since both were used interchangeably) was present\\nin some form during the Delhi Sultanate also. The position of Wazir had lost its pre-\\neminent position during the period of Afghan rulers in the Delhi Sultanate. The posi-\\ntion of the wazir was revived under the Mughals. Babur’s and Humayun’s wazir\\nenjoyed great powers. The period during which Bairam Khan (1556–60) was regent\\nof Akbar, saw the rise of wakil-wazir with unlimited powers. Akbar in his determina-\\ntion to curb the powers of wazir later on took away the financial powers from him.\\nThis was a big jolt to wazir’s power.\\n(iii)\\nDiwan-i-Kul\\nDiwan-i Kul was the chief diwan. He was responsible for revenue and finances.\\nAkbar had strengthened the office of diwan by entrusting the revenue powers to the\\ndiwan. The diwan used to inspect all transaction and payments in all departments and\\nsupervised the provincial diwans. The entire revenue collection and expenditure of\\nthe empire was under his charge. The diwans were to report about state finance to\\nthe Emperor on daily basis.\\nFig 12.1 Royal Court\\n198\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nAdministrative System and Institutions\\n(iv) Mir Bakshi\\nMir Bakshi looked after all matters pertaining to the military administration. The\\norders of appointment of mansabdars and their salary papers were endorsed and\\npassed by him. He kept a strict watch over proper maintenance of the sanctioned size\\nof armed contingents and war equipage by the mansabdars. The new entrants seek-\\ning service were presented to the Emperor by the Mir Bakshi.\\n(v) Sadr-us Sudur\\nThe Sadr-us Sudur was the head of the ecclesiastical department. His chief duty was to\\nprotect the laws of the Shariat. The office of the Sadr used to distribute allowances and\\nstipends to the eligible persons and religious institutions. It made this office very lucrative\\nduring the first twenty-five years of Akbar’s reign. The promulgation of Mahzar in 1580\\nrestricted his authority. According to Mahzar Akbar’s view was to prevail in case of\\nconflicting views among religious scholars. This officer also regulated the matters of rev-\\nenue free grants given for religious and charitable purposes. Later several restrictions\\nwere placed on the authority of the Sadr for award of revenue free grants also.\\nMuhtasibs (censors of public morals) were appointed to ensure the general obser-\\nvance of the rules of morality. He also used to examine weights and measures and\\nenforce fair prices etc.\\n(vi)\\nMir Saman\\nThe Mir Saman was the officer in-charge of the royal Karkhanas. He was respon-\\nsible for all kinds of purchases and their storage for the royal household. He was also\\nto supervise the manufacturing of different articles for the use of royal household.\\n12.8.2 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION\\nThe Mughal empire was divided into twelve provinces or subas by Akbar. These\\nwere Allhabad, Agra, Awadh, Ajmer, Ahmedabad, Bihar, Bengal, Delhi, Kabul, Lahore,\\nMalwa and Multan. Later on Ahmednagar, Bearar and Khandesh were added. With\\nthe expansion of Mughal empire the number of provinces increased to twenty.\\nEach suba was placed under a Subedar or provincial governor who\\nwas directly appointed by the Emperor. The subedar was head of the province and\\nresponsible for maintenance of general law and order. He was to encourage agricul-\\nture, trade and commerce and take steps to enhance the revenue of the state. He was\\nalso to suppress rebellions and provide army for expeditions.\\nThe head of the revenue department in the suba was the Diwan. He was appointed\\nby the Emperor and was an independent officer. He was to supervise the revenue\\ncollection in the suba and maintain accounts of all expenditures. He was also ex-\\npected to increase the area under cultivation. In many cases advance loans (taqavi)\\nwere given to peasants through his office.\\nThe Bakshi in the province performed the same functions as were performed by Mir\\nBakshi at the centre. He was appointed by the imperial court at the recommenda-\\ntions of the Mir Bakshi. He was responsible for checking and inspecting the horses\\nand soldiers maintained by the mansabdars in the suba. He issued the paybills of both\\nthe mansabdars and the soldiers. Often his office was combined with Waqainiqar. In\\nthis capacity his duty was to inform the centre about the happenings in his province.\\nThe representative of the central Sadr (Sadr-us sudur) at the provincial level was\\ncalled Sadr. He was responsible for the welfare of those who were engaged in reli-\\ngious activities and learning. He also looked after the judicial department and in that\\ncapacity supervised the works of the Qazis.\\n199\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\nThere were some other officers also who were appointed at the provincial level.\\nDarogai-i-Dak was responsible for maintaining the communication channel. He used\\nto pass on letters to the court through the postal runners (Merwars). Waqainavis and\\nwaqainigars were appointed to provide reports directly to the Emperor.\\n12.8.3 LOCAL ADMINISTRATION\\nThe provinces or subas were divided into Sarkars. The Sarkars were divided into\\nParganas. The village was the smallest unit of administration.\\nAt the level of Sarkar, there were two important functionaries, the faujdar and the\\nAmalguzar. The Faujdar was appointed by the imperial order. Sometimes within a\\nSarkar a number of Faujdars existed. At times, their jurisdiction spread over two\\nSarkars even if these belonged to two different subas. Faujdari was an administra-\\ntive division whereas Sarkar was a territorial and revenue division. The primary duty\\nof the faujdar was to safeguard the life and property of the residents of the areas\\nunder his Jurisdiction. He was to take care of law and order problem in his areas and\\nassist in the timely collection of revenue whenever force was required.\\nThe amalguzar or amil was the revenue collector. His duty was to assess and super-\\nvise the revenue collection. He was expected to increase the land under cultivation\\nand induce the peasants to pay revenue willingly. He used to maintain all accounts\\nand send the daily receipt and expenditure report to the provincial Diwan.\\nAt the level of Pragana, the Shiqdar was the executive officer. He assisted the amils\\nin the task of revenue collection. The amils looked after the revenue collection at the\\nPargana level. The quanungo kept all the records of land in the pargana. The Kotwals\\nwere appointed mainly in towns by the imperial government and were incharge of law\\nand order. He was to maintain a register for keeping records of people coming and\\ngoing out of the towns. The Muqaddam was the village head man and the Patwari\\nlooked after the village revenue records. The services of the Zamindars were utilized\\nfor the maintenance of law and order in their areas as well as in the collection of\\nrevenue. The forts were placed under an officer called Qiladar. He was incharge of\\nthe general administration of the fort and the areas assigned in Jagir to him.\\nThe port administration was independent of the provincial authority. The gover-\\nnor of the port was called Mutasaddi who was directly appointed by the Em-\\nperor. The Mutasaddi collected taxes on merchandise and maintained a custom-\\nhouse. He also supervised the mint house at the port.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 12.5\\n1.\\nWhy did Akbar curtail the power of wazir?\\n2.\\nWho was Mir Saman ? What were his duties?\\n3.\\nWho was Mutasaddi ?

The mansabdari\\nsystem, evolved by Akbar with certain changes and modifications, was the basis of\\ncivil and military administrations under the Mughals. The word mansab means a place\\nor position. The mansab awarded to an individual fixed both his status in the official\\nhierarchy and also his salary. It also fixed the number of armed retainers the holders\\nof mansab was to maintain. The system was formulated to streamline rank of the\\nnobles, fix their salary and specify the number of cavalry to be maintained by them.\\nUnder the mansab system ranks were expressed in numerical terms. Abul Fazl states\\nthat Akbar had established 66 grades of Mansabdars ranging from commanders of 10\\nhorsemen to 10,000 horsemen, although only 33 grades have been mentioned by him.\\nInitially a single number represented the rank, personal pay and the size of the contin-\\ngent of the mansabdar. Later the rank of mansabdar came to be denoted by two num-\\nbers - Zat and-Sawar. The Zat denoted personal rank of an official and the Sawar\\nindicated the size of contingents maintained by the mansabdars. Depending on the strength\\nof contingent Mansabdars were placed in three categories. Let us take the example of\\na mansabdar who had a rank of 7000 zat and 7000 sawar (7000/7000). In the first Zat\\nand Sawar ranks were equal (7000/7000). In the second, Sawar rank was lower than\\nthe Zat but stopped at half, or fifty percent, of the Zat rank (7000/4000). In the third,\\nSawar rank was lower than fifty percent of the Zat rank (7000/3000). Thus the Sawar\\nrank was either equal or less than the Zat. Even if the Sawar rank was higher, the\\nmansabdar’s position in the official hierarchy would not be affected. It will be decided\\nby the Zat rank. For example, a mansabdar with 4000 Zat and 2000 Sawar was higher\\nin rank than a Mansabdar of 3000 Zat and 3000 Sawar.\\nBut there were exceptions to this rule particularly when the mansabdar was serving\\nin a difficult terrian amidst the rebels. In such cases the state often increased the\\nSawar rank without altering the Zat rank. Some times Sawar rank was also increased\\nfor a temporary period to meet emergency situations.\\nJahangir introduced a new provision in the Sawar rank. According to it a part of\\nSawar rank was termed du-aspa sih-aspa in case of select mansabdars. For this\\npart additional payment at the same rate 8,000 dams per Sawar was sanctioned. Thus\\nif the Sawar rank was 4000 out of which 1000 was du-aspa sih-aspa, salary for this\\nSawar was calculated as 3,000 × 8,000 + (1,000 × 8,000’ × 2) = 40,000,000 dams.\\nWithout du-aspa sih-aspa, salary for the 4,000 Sawar would have stood at (4,000 ×\\n8,000) = 32,000,000 dams. Thus the mansabdar was to maintain double number of\\nSawars for the du-aspa sih-aspa category and was paid for it. Jahangir probably intro-\\nduced this provision to promote nobles of his confidence and strengthen them militarily.\\nBy this provision he could increase the military strength of his nobles without effecting\\nany change in their Zat rank. Any increase in their Zat rank would not only have led to\\njealously among other nobles but also an additional burden on the treasury.\\nShahjahan introduced the month-scale in the, mansabdari system to compensate the\\ngap between Jama (estimated income) and hasil (actual realisation). The mansabaars\\nwere generally paid through revenue assignments Jagirs. The biggest problem was\\nthat calculation was made on the basis of the expected income (Jama) from the Jagir\\nduring one year. It was noticed that the actual revenue collection (hasil) always fell\\n201\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\nshort of the estimated income. In such a situation, the mansabdar’s salary were fixed\\nby a method called month-scale. Thus, if a Jagir yielded only half of the Jama, it was\\ncalled Shashmaha (six monthly), if it yielded only one fourth, it was called Sihmaha\\n(three monthly). The month scale was applied to cash salaries also. There were deduc-\\ntions from the sanctioned pay also. During the reign of Shahjahan the mansabdars were\\nallowed to maintain 1/5 to 1/3 of the sanctioned strength of the Sawar rank without any\\naccompanying reduction in their claim on the maintenance amount for the Sawar rank.\\nAurangzeb continued with all these changes and created an additional rank called\\nMashrut (conditional). This was an attempt to increase the sawar rank of the\\nmansabdar temporarily. Aurangzeb added one another deduction called Khurak-i-\\ndawwab, towards meeting the cost for feed of animals in the imperial stables.\\n(ii)\\nJagir System\\nThe system of assignment of revenue of a particular territory to the nobles for their\\nservices to the state continued under the Mughals also. Under the Mughals, the areas\\nassigned were generally called Jagir and its holders Jagirdars. The Jagirdari system\\nwas an integral part of the mansabdari system which developed under Akbar and under-\\nwent certain changes during the reign of his successors. During Akbar’s period all the\\nterritory was broadly divided into two: Khalisa and Jagir. The revenue from the first went\\nto imperial treasury, and that from Jagir was assigned to Jagirdars in lieu of their cash\\nsalary. Salary entitlements of mansabdars were calculated on the basis of their Zat and\\nSawar ranks. The salary was paid either in cash (in that case they were called Naqdi) or\\nthrough the assignment of a Jagir, the latter being the preferable mode. In case the\\npayment was made through the assignment of a Jagir, the office of the central Diwan\\nwould identify parganas the sum total of whose Jama was equal to the salary claim of the\\nmansabdars. In case the recorded Jama was in excess of salary claim the assignee was\\nrequired to deposit the balance with the central treasury. On the other hand, if it was less\\nthan the salary claim the short fall was paid from the treasury.\\nHowever, none of the assignments was permanent or hereditary. The Emperor could\\nshift part or the entire Jagir from one part of the imperial territory to another at any\\ntime. The ratio between Jagir and Khalisa kept fluctuating during the Mughal rule.\\nDuring Akbar’s period Khalisa was only 5% of total revenue, under Jahangir it was\\n10%, under Shahjahan it fluctuated between 9 to 15%. In the latter part of Aurangzeb’s\\nreign there was a great pressure on the Khalisa as the number of claimants for Jagir\\nincreased with the increase in the number of mansabdars. The jagirdars were also trans-\\nferred from one Jagir to another (but in certain cases they were allowed to keep their\\nJagir in one locality for longer period of time). The system of transfer checked the Jagirdars\\nfrom developing local roots. At the same time, its disadvantage was that it discouraged the\\nJagirdars from taking long term measures for the development of their areas.\\nThere were various types of Jagirs. Tankha Jagirs were given in lieu of salaries,\\nMashrut Jagirs were given on certain conditions, Watan Jagirs were assigned to\\nZamindar or rajas in their local dominions. Altamgha Jagirs were given to Muslim nobles\\nin their family towns or place of birth. Tankha Jagirs were transferable every three to\\nfour years. Watan Jagirs were hereditary and non transferable. When a Zamindar was\\nmade a mansabdar, he was given Tankha Jagir apart from his watan Jagir at another\\nplace, if the salary of his rank was more than the income from his watan Jagir.\\nThe Jagirdars were allowed to collect only authorized revenue in accordance with\\nthe imperial regulations. The jagirdars employed their own officials like amil etc. The\\nimperial office kept watch on the Jagirdars. The Diwan of the suba was supposed\\n202\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nAdministrative System and Institutions\\nto prevent the oppression of the peasants by the Jagirdars.

The administrative system of the Marathas was very much influenced by\\nthe administrative system of the Mughals and the Deccani states.\\n(i)\\nCentral Administration\\nThe king was at the helm of the affairs. The administration was divided into eight depart-\\nments headed by ministers who are some times called Ashta pradhan. The eight minis-\\nters were (1) Peshwa who looked after the finances and general administration. (2) Sar-\\ni-Naubat who was the Senapati. (3) Majumdar looked after the accounts. (4) Waqai\\nnavis looked after the intelligence, post and household affairs (5) Surnavis or Chitnis\\nlooked after official correspondence (6) Dabir looked after foreign affairs (7) Nyayadhish\\nlooked after justice and (8) Pandit Rao looked after ecclesiastical affairs.\\nThe ashtapradhan was not a creation of Shivaji. Many of these officers like Peshwa,\\nMajumdar, Waqai navis, Dabir and Surnavis had existed under the Deccani rulers\\nalso. All the members of the astha pradhan except Pandit Rao and Nyaydhish were\\nasked to lead military campaigns. Under Shivaji these offices were neither hereditary\\nnor permanent. They held the office at the pleasure of the king. They were also\\nfrequently transferred. Each of the ashta pradhan was assisted by eight assistants\\ndiwan, Majumdar, Fadnis, Sabnis; Karkhanis, Chitnis, Jamadar and Potnis.\\nChitnis dealt with all diplomatic correspondences and wrote all royal letters. The\\nFadnis used to respond to the letters of commanders of the forts. The potnis looked\\nafter the income and expenditure of the royal treasury.\\n(ii)\\nProvincial and Local Administration\\nThe provincial administration was also organized on the Deccani and Mughal system.\\nAll the provincial units were already existing under the Deccani rulers. Shivaji reorga-\\nnized and in certain cases renamed them. The provinces were known as Prants. The\\nPrants were under the charge of subedar. Over a number of Subedar there were\\nSarsubedar to control and supervise the work of subedar. Smaller than prant were\\nTarfs which were headed by a havaldar. Then there were Mauzas or villages which\\nwere the lowest unit of administration. At the level of village, Kulkarni used to keep\\n203\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Administrative System and Institutions\\naccounts and maintained records while Patil had legal and policing power. At the level\\nof Pargana, Deshpande used to keep account and maintain records while Deshmukh\\nhad legal and policing powers. The Police officer in rural area was called Faujdar and\\nin urban area was called Kotwal. The Maratha polity did not have unified civilian-cum-\\nmilitary rank. Under the Marathas performance based Brahmin elites manned the cen-\\ntral bureaucracy and the local administration. In this capacity they were called\\nKamvishdar who enjoyed wide powers of tax assessment and collection. They adjudi-\\ncated cases, provided information about local conditions and kept records.

The administrative institutions were of mix origin\\ni.e., Arab and Central Asian origin and Indian origin . During the Mughal period some of the\\ninstitution of the Sultanate period underwent some changes and some new were created.\\nThe administration system and institutions contributed in the consolidation of the Sultanate\\nand Mughal empire. The administrative system was also utilized by the rulers to create\\nsocial harmony in the society. This was done by including more and more sections of the\\nsociety in the administrative apparatus. Due to the large extent of the empire the administra-\\ntive system emerged at three levels i.e. central, provincial and local. The local level admin-\\nistration was left mainly in the hands of village headmen etc. At provincial level, the admin-\\nistration was carried out through the institution of Iqta during the sultanate period and\\nthrough the institution of mansab and jagir during the Mughal period. At the central\\nlevel the sultan or the emperor had his own system of administration and there were\\nmany officers to assist him. There were also various departments to look after certain\\nfunctions. The rulers at times were challenged by the nobility and the Ulema who tried\\nto exert pressure on them. The administrative system and institutions functioned well under\\nstrong and capable ruler but the same were under pressure under weak rulers.

The sphere of their works varied from agricultural to artisanal production,\\ntrade and commerce and associated commercial and financial services. These activities\\nunderwent various changes through out the course of this period. The state mobilized its\\nresources through collection of different types of taxes for its survival and expansion.\\nIn this lesson, you will learn about various ways and means of production, mobilization of\\nresources by the state and the trade and commercial activities. In the section on agricul-\\ntural production, we will discuss extent of cultivation, crop pattern and means and methods\\nof irrigation. Under the taxation system land revenue administration, role of landed inter-\\nmediaries in the revenue administration and burden on peasantry will be analysed. In the\\nsection on non-agricultural production, you will learn about a wide variety of medieval\\nIndian crafts, technologies of production involved therein and organisation of production.\\nYou will also learn various aspects of the medieval Indian trade and commerce like com-\\nmercial classes such as the sarrafs, merchants, brokers etc. and commercial practices,\\nsuch as, bills of exchange (hundi), brokerage, insurance etc.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to:\\n \\nknow the extent of cultivation; main crops grown;means and methods of irriga-\\ntion in India;\\n \\nanalyze revenue system of Medieval India;\\n \\nknow the role of landed intermediaries in the revenue collection;\\n \\ndiscuss the production of various articles of craft;\\n \\nappreciate how non-agricultural production was organized;\\n \\ndescribe inland and foreign trade;\\n \\nknow the main commercial practices and personnel of trade and\\n \\ndescribe the currency system of this period.\\n13.1 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION\\nAgricultural production constituted the bulk of production during medieval period. The\\nincome from agriculture was the main source of state revenue.\\n208\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\n(i)\\nExtent of Cultivation\\nExtent of cultivation may be understood in terms of actual area under the plough in\\nrelation to the total available cultivable land. It is to be noted that there was a favourable\\nratio of land to man i.e., availability of land in surplus than the actual land cultivated by\\npeasants. In such a situation an increase in production was sought through expansion\\nof agriculture i.e., bringing newer areas under cultivation.\\nWe are informed, for instance, by the contemporary sources that large tracts of land\\nin even such fertile regions as the Ganga-Yamuna Doab were covered by forests and\\ngrasslands during the Sultanate period. Land continued to exist in a favourable ratio to\\nman during the Mughal period as well.\\nThe rulers of this era, therefore, harped on the policy of expansion of agriculture to such\\nareas which were hitherto not under cultivation. Agriculture was introduced to tribal,\\nbackward, and outlying areas. Forests were cleared and agricultural wastelands were\\nconverted into cultivable lands. Extent of agriculture expanded in good proportions from\\nthe Sultanate to Mughal period. By the Mughal period, agriculture was practiced in\\nalmost all parts of the empire, yet land still existed in huge surplus than the actual re-\\nquirement of the Mughal agricultural population. The extent of cultivation significantly\\nincreased during the reign of Aurangzeb in comparison to the Akbar’s reign. The expan-\\nsion of cultivation in Bihar, Awadh and parts of Bengal is ascribed to clearance of forest,\\nwhereas in Punjab and Sind, to the spread of canal network.\\n(ii)\\nCrop Pattern\\nThe medieval Indian peasants produced a variety of food crops, cash crops, veg-\\netables and spices. They were familiar with various advanced techniques of crop\\ncultivation of their times viz., double cropping, three crops harvesting, crop rotation,\\nuse of manures and range of devices for irrigation etc.\\na.\\nFood crops: The principal food crops produced were rice, wheat, barley,\\nmil-let (jowar,’bajra) and a variety of pulses such as gram, arhar, moong,\\nmoth, urd, khisari etc.\\nb.\\nCash crops: Sugarcane, cotton, indigo (used to extract blue dye), opium, silk\\netc. were some of the prominent cash crops of medieval India. Making of\\nwine from sugarcane became widespread by the fourteenth century. During\\nthe Mughal period, sugarcane was the most widely grown cash crop with\\nBengal producing the finest quality.\\nDuring the Mughal period, Bayana (near Agra) and Sarkhej (near Ahmedabad)\\nproduced the best quality Indigo. Sericulture (rearing of silk worms on mulbery\\nplant), which was practised on a modest scale till the Sultanate period, became\\nwidespread during the Mughal period. Bengal emerged as the main region of\\nsilk production. The Mughal provinces of Bihar and Malwa produced the finest\\nquality of opium. Tobacco cultivation was introduced in India by the Portuguese\\nduring the sixteenth century and it became widespread in the subsequent pe-\\nriod. Surat and Bihar emerged as major tobacco producing centres. Similarly,\\nfrom the seventeenth century, cultivation of coffee began on a large scale.\\nc.\\nFruits and Vegetables: Fruit crop cultivation developed rapidly during the\\nmedieval period. Some of the Delhi sultans actively promoted growing of\\nfruit crops. Firuz Shah Tughlaq, for instance, laid down 1200 orchards in the\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Economy\\n209\\nvicinity of Delhi. Mughal emperors and their nobles also planted lavish or-\\nchards.\\nDuring the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a number of\\nfruits were introduced in India through outside agencies. The Portuguese for\\ninstance, introduced pineapple, papaya and cashew nut; etc. Cherry was\\nbrought from Kabul. Leechi and guava were also introduced during this\\nperiod. A wide range of vegetables were also produced by the medieval In-\\ndian peasants. Abul FazI, in his Ain-i-Akbari, gives a list of vegetables which\\nwere, in use at that time. Potato, Chilies and tomato were introduced during\\nthe late medieval period.\\nd.\\nSpices: Pepper, clove, cardamom, turmeric, saffron, betel-leaf, etc. were\\nsome of the important spices produced by the medieval Indian peasants. By\\nthe Mughal period, the southern coast of India began exporting in large quan-\\ntities different kinds of spices to various regions in Asia and Europe.\\n(iii)\\nMeans and Methods of Irrigation\\nThe Indian agriculture has always depended on various sources of water both natural and\\nartificial, for its irrigational requirements, viz - rain, wells, river, tanks, canals, lakes, etc.\\nDams, lakes and water reservoirs were some of the important means of irrigation. In\\nsouth India, the state, local chiefs and temple managements constructed a number of\\ndams over rivers for this purpose. The Madag lake, for instance, was built by the\\nVijaynagar rulers on the Tungbhadra river to meet the irrigational need of the adjoin-\\ning territories. Lakes and water reservoirs such as the Dhebar, Udaisagar, Rajasamand\\nand Jaisamand (all in Mewar); Balsan (Marwar) and Mansagar (Amber) etc. served\\nas important sources of irrigation in medieval Rajasthan.\\nWells, as a common source of irrigation, were uniformly spread in different parts of\\nthe country. A number of artificial devices were used to lift water from wells. Pulleys\\nwere employed over wells for this purpose. Another device worked on the lever\\nprinciple. In this method, fork of an upright beam was kept in a swinging position with\\nits one end tied with a long rope and the other carried a weight heavier than the filled\\nbucket. The Persian wheel which began to be used in India from the Sultanate pe-\\nriod, however, was the most advanced water lifting device of this period. In this\\nmethod, a garland of pots was attached to the rim of a wheel, a gear mechanism was\\nalso attached to it, and with the help of animal power this wheel was made to rotate.\\nThe Delhi Sultans, in particular, promoted canal irrigation. Ghiyassuddin Tughlaq\\n(A.D 1320–1325) built a number of canals for this purpose. However, Firuz Shah Tughlaq\\nlaid the largest network of canals. Four such canals are frequently mentioned in contempo-\\nrary sources. These were - (i) from Sutlej to Ghaggar, (ii) Opening from the Nandavi and\\nSimur hills to Arasani, (iii) from Ghaggar, reaching upto the village to Hiransi Khera, and (iv)\\nexcavated from Yamuna and extended upto Firuzabad. The tradition of Delhi Sultans to\\nconstruct canals was continued by the Mughal emperors as well. The Nahr Faiz, for in-\\nstance, built during Shahjahan’s reign carried water from Yamuna and irrigated a large area.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 13.1\\n1.\\nWhat was the availability of land for agriculture?\\n210\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\n2.\\nList four food crops and four cash crops of medieval India.\\n3.\\nList four crops which were introduced in India during the medieval period.\\n4.\\n What was a Persian Wheel?\\n13.2 LAND REVENUE ASSESSMENT AND MAGNITUDE OF THE\\nLAND REVENUE DEMAND\\nThe medieval state derived the largest share of its income from land revenue. An elabo-\\nrate mechanism of land revenue administration gradually developed due to efforts of\\nmedieval rulers like Alauddin Khalji, Sher Shah Suri and Akbar. In its developed form,\\nthe land revenue administration involved well formulated policies. These were: (i) actual\\nmeasurement of cultivable land for the purpose of assessment of land revenue (ii) clas-\\nsification of land on the basis of the fertility of soil (iii) fixation of rate of the land revenue\\ndemand (iv) establishment of elaborate mechanism for its collection, and (v) working\\nout modalities for assessment and collection of land revenue in cash.\\nDuring the medieval period different methods of revenue assessment and collection\\nwere used. The most simple and basic method was crop sharing or batai. The state\\nfixed a certain ratio of produce as state’s share. In this method out of the total produce\\nthe state share was collected by designated official. Here the measurement of land had\\nno bearing on revenue collection. The actual produce was the main focus of attention.\\nCrop Sharing\\nThree types of crop sharing was in practice. These were - first, division of crop at thresh-\\ning floor after the grain was obtained; second, Khet-batai, i.e. division of field when the\\ncrop was standing; and third, the Langbatai in which the crop was cut and stacked in\\nheaps without separating grain. The share of the state was decided in this form.\\nIn the second method known as Kankut the measurement was important. In this\\nmethod land was first measured. After measurement the productivity of land was\\nestimated to fix the revenue demand per unit of measured area. Sher Shah improved\\nthe method of assessment. For estimating the productivity sample cutting from three\\ntypes of land i.e. good, middling and bad lands was taken and an average yield was\\nobtained. The State demand was fixed at 1/3rd of the average yield.\\nRevenue demand per bigha for every crop was declared and was known as rai of\\nSher Shah. During initial years of Akbar these rates were adopted for the whole\\nempire. Here the state demand was expressed in kind but could be collected/paid in\\ncash after applying prevalent prices on them.\\nThis Third method was called Zabt since the assessment was done on the basis of\\nmeasurement. Based on yields the share of the state was decided. Under Akbar the\\nmethod was further refined. All the territories were divided into the revenue circles or\\ndasturs. For each dastur circle per bigha revenue rates for different crops in cash\\nbased on productivity and prices was worked out.\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Economy\\n211\\nThe problem of compiling fresh rates every year for different localities was over-\\ncome through adoption of Ain-i-Dahsala or ten years revenue rates According to\\nthis the average of the rates of last ten years was taken as cash revenue rate for a\\nparticular crop. However, these were changed at irregular intervals and not updated\\nevery year. In the beginning it was implemented in the provinces of Agra, AIlahabad,\\nAwadh, Delhi, Lahore and Malwa. Later it was extended to some other regions.\\nHowever at no point of time all the land in a particular region was measured. That\\nwould suggest that even in measured territories some territories remained unmea-\\nsured. In such a situation even in the zabti regions other methods of assessment and\\ncollection were followed in almost all parts of the country.\\nClassification of land\\nAfter the measurement, the cultivable land was classified, on the basis of the fertility\\nof land, into three categories- good, middling and bad. Land was further classified\\ninto four categories viz -polaj, parati, chachar and banjar, on the basis of continu-\\nity of cultivation. The Polaj land was one in which two crops were raised every\\nyear; Parati land, however, had to be left fallow (uncultivated) for some time, after\\nraising two crops to recover its fertility; the Chachar was an unfertile tract of land\\nwhich was brought under cultivation once in every three or four years; and the Banjar\\nland which was unfit for cultivation and therefore rarely brought under plough.\\nThe land revenue constituted the bulk of the state’s income. The state, therefore,\\nconstantly tried to expand the territory under cultivation to maximize its revenue re-\\nturns. All efforts of the State were also focussed in ensuring maximum realization of\\nrevenue from the cultivators.\\nThe Mughal land revenue administration was organised at the pargana level. The\\ntask of surveying of land and collection of revenue was entrusted to different offi-\\ncials. Amin was the head of the surveying party whereas the amil was incharge of\\nrevenue collections. The amin was assisted by the qanungo who was repository of\\nall revenue records. The chaudhari assisted the amil in this work of revenue collec-\\ntion. At the village level, the records were maintained by the patwari and collections\\nwere made by the muqaddam or village headman. There were other officials such as\\npotadar or treasurer and karkun or clerk. The records were maintained both in\\nPersian and languages of the region.\\nPatta and Qabuliat\\nEach cultivator was given a document by the state called patta (title deed) which\\ngave all the details of the various categories of land held by the cultivator and rate of\\nland revenue payable by him on different crops. A deed agreement called Qabuliat,\\naccording to which the cultivator made a promise to pay a particular amount of land\\nrevenue to the state, was taken from the cultivator. In addition to the land revenue,\\nthe cultivators were also required to pay certain additional cesses, in order to meet\\nthe cost of assessment and collection of revenues.\\n \\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 13.2\\n1.\\nWhat was the difference between Khet batai and the Lang batai?\\n212\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\n2.\\nName three medieval Indian rulers whose land revenue policies contributed to the\\ndevelopment of elaborate mechanism of land revenue administration.\\n3.\\nWhat were Polaj Parati and Chachar lands?\\n4.\\nWhat is Patta and Qabuliyat?\\n13.3 ROLE OF LANDED INTERMEDIARIES IN REVENUE\\nCOLLECTION\\nApart form state officials various categories of intermediaries existed between the\\npeasants and the state. These intermediaries played a crucial role in land revenue\\nrealization. They claimed revenue exemptions on their lands or a share in land rev-\\nenue in return for the services rendered by them.\\nPrior to the establishment of the Delhi sultanate our sources refer to terms like raja,\\nrajaputra, ranaka, mahasamanta etc. These were hereditary right holders con-\\nnected with land. They collected land revenue from peasants of their respective ar-\\neas, sent a part of it to the state and kept a part with themselves for their sustenance.\\nBesides, as we have seen, the state granted tax-exempt land to Brahamans and temples.\\nLand revenue from such areas were collected by these grantees.\\nDuring the Sultanate period, landed intermediaries continued to play an important role\\nin revenue collection. Khuts (small landlords), Muqaddams (village headmen) and a\\ngroup of intermediaries, such as, rai, rana, rawats etc., enjoyed superior rights over\\nland as compared to an average peasant. Alauddin Khalji tried to curtail the powers\\nand shares of these groups. Later Delhi Sultans like Ghiyassuddin and Firuz Shah\\nTughlaq gave certain concessions to them.\\nDuring the Mughal period rais, ranas, rawats and other such intermediaries are\\nreferred as zamindar. They were the people who had hereditary rights over the\\nproduce of the land.\\nThe zamindars claimed a direct share in the peasants produce. Their share varied\\nfrom 10% to 25% in different parts of the country. These claims co-existed in a\\nsubordinate capacity with the land revenue demand of the state. Zamindars also\\nassisted the state and jagirdar in the collection of land revenue. Iqta of the Sultanate\\nperiod in a modified form became Jagir under the Mughals. Its holders (jagirdars)\\nwere paid through revenue assignments. We have already discussed them in chapter\\n12. The muqaddams (in north India) and patels (in Deccan) acted as village head-\\nmen who were responsible for collection of revenue and maintenance of law and\\norder in the village. For their services, they were granted revenue free village land.\\nThe patwari (in north India) and kulkarni (in Deccan), who served as village ac-\\ncountants, were also paid similarly.\\n13.4 BURDEN ON PEASANTRY\\nPeasants formed the overwhelming majority of the population in medieval India. It\\nwas, however, not a homogenous group. One end of the spectrum was represented\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Economy\\n213\\nby rich peasants (khuts & muqaddams during Delhi Sultanate and khudkasht during\\nthe Mughal period), having large holdings and cultivating their lands with the help of\\nhired labour. The other end was represented by small peasants and village menials\\n(known in various parts of India as balahars, reza ria’ya, paltis, kunbis, pahika’asht,\\nupari etc.). Bulk of the peasantry was known by the generic term raiyat.\\nOverall, the peasants had to pay large parts of their produce as land revenue. Be-\\nsides, a large number of landed intermediaries appropriated a share in the surplus of\\nproduce. Apart from it, the medieval Indian peasants also had to deal with frequent\\nnatural calamities like flood, famine, epidemics etc. An average peasant always found\\nhimself subsisting on margins owing to the regressive nature of land tax, the extensive\\nburden of interaction on loans taken, frequent famine, disease and epidemic.\\nThe peasant hardships and resentments, occasionally, culminated in protests and revolts.\\nDuring the Sultanate period, Muhammad bin Tughlaq’s effort to enhance the revenue rates\\nin the doab region led to a very serious agrarian uprising in the region. Large scale uprisings\\nof the Jats, Sikh, Marathas, and Satanamis, took place during the reign of Emperor\\nAurangzeb. Agrarian discontentment was one of the factors behind these rebellious acts.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 13.3  \\n1.\\nWho were Rajaputra, Ranaka and Mahasamanta?\\n2.\\nWho were Muqaddams and Patels?\\n3.\\nList some of the important peasant uprisings of the Mughal period.\\n13.5 ARTISANAL (NON-AGRICULTURAL) PRODUCTION\\nThough agriculture formed the occupation of the bulk of the people, a variety of crafts\\nalso existed on a significant scale in rural as well as urban areas of the country. These\\ncrafts included textile, pottery making, dyeing, sugar making, metal works, paper making,\\nwood work, arms and armour manufacturing, ship-building, chemical works etc.\\nProminent Crafts\\nThe textile production was one of the most widely practised crafts of medieval India.\\nThe Indian weavers produced four major types of fabric - cotton, silk, woollen, and\\nmixed coarse cotton. Bengal, Lahore, Agra, Awadh, Patna, Fatehpur Sikri and Gujarat\\netc. were prominent cotton textile production regions. Kashmir, Lahore and Agra\\nwere major shawl and carpet making centres. Apart from manufacturing, Bengal and\\nGujarat were renowned for the export of textile goods.\\nThe art of dyeing or bleaching developed as a separate and specialised craft during\\nthis period. Bharuch, Ahmadabad, Surat, Patna, Sonargaon, Dacca, Masulipattam\\netc. were major dyeing or bleaching centres.\\nSugar was manufactured all over the country. Sugar in its variants - Gur; powder, fine\\ngrained sugar etc. were produced in Bengal, Orissa, Ahmedabad, Lahore, Multan and\\nmany other places.\\n214\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\nMineral extraction was another major industry. Salt, saltpetre, alum, mica etc. were\\nproduced on a large scale. The Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, the Punjab rock salt mines\\nand sea water were some major sources of salt production. Sea salt was mainly\\nmanufactured in Bengal, Sind, Malabar, Mysore and the Rann of Kutch. Saltpetre,\\nprimarily used as an ingredient for manufacturing gun powder, was one of the most\\nimportant mineral products. Initially, it was extracted at Ahmadabad, Baroda, Patna\\netc.. However, by the second half of the seventeenth century, Patna became one of\\nthe most important centres for processing this mineral.\\nAmong metals, India was deficient in gold and silver mines. These metals, therefore,\\nwere mostly imported. Diamond mining was carried out most notably at Golconda.\\nSome other centres of diamond production were Biragarh (Berar), Panna (Madhya\\nPradesh), Khokhra (Chotanagpur) etc.. Khetri (Rajasthan) was the main centre for\\ncopper production. Iron was the most commonly found metal. Bengal, Allahabad,\\nAgra, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Kashmir, Chotanagpur and adjoining regions of Orissa\\nwere major iron producing centres of the medieval period.\\nPaper making, as a craft, was introduced in India during the Sultanate period. It was first\\nmanufactured in China around the first century A.D. The craft grew at a fast pace. The\\nmanufacture of paper was prevalent during the Mughal period in almost every region.\\nThe medieval period witnessed advent of a number of new technological devices and\\ntheir application in diverse sectors.\\nIn the textile sector, introduction of the spinning wheel (charkha), during the thir-\\nteenth-fourteenth centuries, was the most important technological innovation. It speeded\\nup yarn production by six times in comparison to the spindle based yarn production.\\nSimilarly, pit loom was introduced in India during the fifteenth century, which speeded\\nup the process of weaving. Drawloom was another important weaving device which\\nwas used for simultaneous patterned weave of different colours. Similarly, block-print-\\ning is also attributed by some scholars to the medieval Indian period.\\nIn the sector of metallurgy and metal works, many new technologies were introduced\\nin the process of manufacturing. Some of such technologies were -employment of\\nvertical bore pits, deep mines with oval shafts, use of pulley etc. Production of high\\nquality steel and bidri alloy of copper and zinc were new metal works of this period.\\nIn the arms and armour manufacturing sector, use of gunpowder, canon, firearm etc,\\nwere some of the most important medieval innovations. The modern artillery was\\nmainly brought to India, on the one hand, by Babur (who had received it from Persia),\\non the other hand, by the Portuguese. Besides, Fatullah Shirazi, an outstanding scholar\\nand engineer of Akbar’s regime, made some invaluable innovations in this sector.\\nPaper-making, as we have noted above, entered India during this period. Along with\\nit also developed the craft of book binding.\\nAlthough, glass making technology was known to the Indians during the ancient pe-\\nriod, its use was restricted to manufacturing beads and bangles. During the medieval\\nperiod, various other glass products such as, pharmaceutical phials, vessels etc. also\\nbegan to be manufactured. The practice of tin coating also entered India along with\\nthe advent of the Turks. This technology involved coating of tin inside the copper and\\nbrass utensils to prevent the food from acid poisoning.\\nOrganisation of Production\\nCraft production was organised in villages as well as qasbas. There also existed\\nimperial Karkhanas. In rural areas, artisans produced articles of daily use. These\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Economy\\n215\\nartisans were part of the village social network called the jajmani system. This sys-\\ntem was more organised in Deccan and Maharashtra. The village artisans and ser-\\nvants in these regions were called balutedars.\\nTown based individual artisans formed the nucleus of such commodities which were\\nproduced for markets. Almost every craft had specialised artisans who produced\\narticles for the market. At this level of the organisation of craft production, the indi-\\nvidual artisan himself procured necessary raw materials and tools, manufactured com-\\nmodities, and sold those in the market.\\nThis mode of artisanal production, however, suffered from a major weakness. Since the\\nproduction was organised on individual basis, an artisan lacked big resources to invest in\\nthe production process. Naturally, the size of final production remained small. A revised\\nform of production called the dadni system gradually developed to address this prob-\\nlem. In this system, an artisan was provided with necessary raw materials and advance\\nmoney by such merchants who traded in those commodities. After the expiry of stipu-\\nlated time, the merchants collected finished goods and sold them in the market.\\nRoyal workshop (karkhana) was another unit of craft production. These karkhanas\\nwere part of the royal establishment. These units produced commodities for the con-\\nsumption of the royal household and the court, Generally, expensive and luxury items\\nwere produced here. The Karkhanas employed skilled workers who worked under\\none roof and were supervised by state officials. Apparently two distinct types of\\nKarkhanas existed. First, the traditional type of Karkhanas, which produced luxury\\ngoods in small quantity, but of high, artistic value; second, mints or arms manufactur-\\ning units, wherein standard oriented and technologically advanced large scale produc-\\ntion took place.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 13.4 \\n1. Name five important crafts of medieval India.\\n2. Name three important centres of saltpetre production.\\n3. Name four important centres of diamond production.\\n4. Name three important technological devices used in the textile production.\\n 13.6 TRADE AND COMMERCE\\nIndia had a fairly developed external and internal trade during the medieval period.\\nThe internal trade developed along local, regional and inter-regional levels. Trade\\nrelations with regions like China, Arabia, Egypt, Central Asia, Afghanistan were main-\\ntained on land routes. It carried its overseas trade with the Persian Gulf, the South\\nChina sea, the Mediterranean and the Red sea. The advent of European trading\\ncompanies - the Portuguese, British, Dutch and French intensified trading activities in\\n216\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\nthe Indian subcontinent. The Asian maritime trade also increased during this period.\\nThis period also witnessed proliferation of a variety of new commercial activities\\nsuch as, money lending, brokerage, insurance etc. We notice a large number of mer-\\nchants, sarrafs, brokers etc. playing active role in commercial activities.\\n(i)\\nInland Trade\\nBy the Mughal period, inland trade had developed considerably. Every locality had\\nregular markets in nearby towns where people from the surrounding areas could sell\\nand purchase things. Besides, trade at the local level was also conducted through\\nperiodic markets known as Hats or Penths, which were held on fixed days in a week.\\nIn these local markets, commodities like food grain, salt, wooden and iron equipments,\\ncoarse cotton textile etc. were available.\\nThese local markets were linked to bigger commercial centres in that particular re-\\ngion. These centres served as markets for products not only from their specific region\\nbut also from other regions. Delhi, Agra, Lahore, Multan, Bijapur, Hyderabad, Calicut,\\nCochin, Patna etc. were some of such trading regions during the Mughal period.\\nA brisk inter-regional trade was conducted in luxury commodities. Ziauddin Barani in\\nhis Ta’arikh-i-Firuzshahi shows that Delhi during the Sultanate period received dis-\\ntilled wine from Kol (Aligarh), muslin from Devagiri, stripped cloth from Lakhnauati\\nand ordinary cloth from Awadh. During the Mughal period, Bengal with its important\\ntrading centres - Hugli, Dacca, Murshidabad, Satagaon, Patna had well developed\\ninter-regional trade with all parts of India. Similarly, Surat and Ahmadabad in Western\\nIndia and Agra in North India were some of the important centres with fairly devel-\\noped inter-regional trade.\\n(ii)\\nForeign Trade\\nIndia had traditionally been maintaining trade relations with other countries. During\\nthe early medieval period (i.e. from the tenth century onward), India carried trade\\nwith contemporary China, Arabia and Egypt. India also had high stake in the sea trade\\nbetween the Persian Gulf and the South China sea. India imported silk, porcelain\\nware, camphor, cloves, wax, sandalwood etc from China and South Asia and horses\\nfrom places such as Bahrin, Muscat, Aden, Persia etc. The Indian exports included\\naromatics and spices, cotton cloth, ivory and precious and semi-precious stones etc.\\nDuring the Sultanate period, India had trade relations with Central Asia, Afghanistan,\\nthe Persian gulf and the Red sea. India mainly exported food grains, textile, slaves,\\nindigo, precious stones etc. whereas it imported precious metals like gold and silver,\\nhorses, brocade and silk stuff etc.\\nIndia, during the Mughal period, witnessed further intensification of her foreign trade\\nowing to the advent of the European trading companies and their direct participation\\nin the Euro-Asian and Intra-Asian trade. India had trade relations with central Asia,\\nPersia and Europe. Her major export included textiles, saltpetre, sugar, opium and\\nspices. In comparison to her export, her imports were limited to a few select com-\\nmodities like silver, silk, porcelain, good quality wine, carpets, perfume, glass, watches,\\nsilver utensils, horses etc.\\n(iii)\\nThe Mercantile Community\\nThroughout the course of the medieval period in India, the mercantile community\\nplayed an important role in the contemporary economy and society.\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Economy\\n217\\nDuring the Sultanate period, Karwanis or Nayakas were merchants, who specialised\\nin carrying grains from the rural areas. The Persian term Karwanis meant those who\\nmoved together in large number. These people came to be called banjaras in the\\nlater centuries. We also get references of Multani merchant who specialised in long\\ndistance trade. They were mostly Hindu merchants.\\nWe hear of a number of mercantile classes during the Mughal period. Banjaras have\\ninnumerable references in the contemporary literature as a trading group who carried\\non trade between villages and between village and towns. They generally moved with\\ntheir families and households in groups. The Multani merchants continued to thrive\\nduring this period as well in places such as Delhi, parts of Punjab and Sind. Baniya\\nwas another important mercantile community in north India and Deccan. Their coun-\\nterparts were Khatris in Punjab and Komatis in Golconda. Apart from their involve-\\nment in trade, they also acted as moneylenders. The Bohras were another prominent\\nmercantile community during the Mughal period. It had a very strong presence in\\nGujarat, Ujjain and Burhanpur. Some of the other prominent mercantile groups were\\nChettis (South India), Kling (along Coromandel coast upto Orissa), Komatis (Telegu\\nspeaking merchant group) etc.\\n(a) Sarrafs: It was a yet another community engaged in monetary transactions.\\nReferences to this community began to appear from the Sultanate period. How-\\never, by the Mughal period, it developed three distinct functions.\\ni.\\nMoney changers - in this role, a sarraf was considered an expert in judging\\nthe metallic purity of coins as well as their weight. He also determined the\\ncurrent exchange rate of specific coins.\\nii. as bankers, they received deposits and gave loans on interest.\\niii. as traders, they dealt in gold, silver and jewellery. Besides, they also issued\\nhundis or bills of exchange.\\n(b) Brokers: Known as dalal, it was another important commercial class. It emerged\\nduring the Sultanate period. However, brokerage became a widespread com-\\nmercial practice during the Mughal period. They worked as middlemen in vari-\\nous commercial activities and transactions. The foreign merchants, who were\\nunacquainted with the centres of production, pattern of marketing and languages,\\nmainly depended upon brokers for their trading. These brokers worked in various\\ncapacities. Some of them were employed by merchants or companies. Some\\nworked as independent broker serving many clients at a time. A few of them\\nworked as state appointed brokers at commercial centres to register sale and\\npurchase of articles. Brokers fee was not strictly fixed. It depended on the com-\\nmodity and the efforts of the broker to strike the deal.\\n(iv)\\nCommercial Practices\\nAlong with the development of trade and  commercial classes, some new commercial\\npractices also developed during the medieval period.\\na. Hundi: Hundi or bills of exchange was a  medieval commercial practice. A\\nhundi was essentially a paper document promising payment of money after\\na fixed period of time at a certain place. This practice started because of the\\nproblems involved in carrying large amounts of cash from one place to an-\\nother. The sarrafs, who played the key role in hundi transaction, generally\\n218\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\nhad number of establishments across various towns and cities. They issued\\nhundis to merchants after accepting the cash to be transferred. The hundis\\nindicated the amount, period and place of encashment. The persons carried\\nhundis to their destinations, presented it to the agents of issuing sarrafs and\\nencashed the value indicated. Apart from merchants state officials and other\\nnobles also used it for transferring money. The hundi system established a\\nsafe and convenient method of transferring money. The sarrafs charged a\\ncommission for every hundi they issued.\\nb.\\nInsurance: This practice became widespread, especially during the Mughal\\nperiod. Certain insurance firms (mostly dominated by sarrafs) developed\\nwhich took upon themselves the responsibility of safe passage and delivery\\nof commercial goods. In case, any damage to the goods in transit happened,\\nthese firms were liable to pay compensations. A commission was charged as\\ninsurance cover of such goods.   The rate of commission varied according to\\ndifferent regions and goods. The rate for overseas transportation of goods\\nwas higher than goods going overland.\\n13.7 THE CURRENCY SYSTEM\\nThe silver and copper coins were mainly in circulation for cash transactions. Under\\nSultanate the pure silver tanka with fluctuating proportion of silver was the main\\ncoinage. The jital and dang were copper coins. The value of coinage fluctuated with\\nthe change in the prices of metals.\\nFig 13.1 Coins\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Economy\\n219\\nUnder Sher Shah for the first time the purity of metals in coinage of gold, silver and\\ncopper was established. The rupaya of silver came to be used as the basic coin for\\ntransactions. It was of 178 grains. The same continued under Akbar with minor fluc-\\ntuation under his successors. The copper dam of the Mughals was 323 grains. The\\nvalue of silver rupee to copper dam fluctuated as per the availability or scarcity of\\nsilver. During Akbar’s period 1 silver rupee was enqual to 40 copper dams. The gold\\nor ashrafi had a weight of 169 grains.\\nThe coins were minted at the royal mints spread in all ports of the kingdom. During\\nAkbar’s period Gold coins were issued from 4 mints, silver coins from 14 and copper\\ncoins from 42 mints. The number of rupee mints increased to 40 by Aurangzeb’s time.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 13.5\\n1. Name five countries with which India maintained overland trade relations during\\nthe medieval period.\\n2.

An increase in agricul-\\ntural production was sought through expansion of agriculture in newer areas as part\\nof state policy. The peasants produced a large variety of food crops, cash crops,\\nfruits, vegetables and spices. They practised advanced agricultural techniques such\\nas croprotation, double cropping, three crop harvesting, fruit grafting etc. Various\\ntypes of artificial water lifting devices were also used for this purpose. The state\\nderived the largest part of its income from land revenue. The land revenue adminis-\\ntration was streamlined and elaborately developed as a result of some of the pioneer-\\ning efforts made in this field by rulers like Alauddin Khalji, Sher Shah Suri and Akbar.\\nA powerful group of revenue intermediaries existed in between the state and the\\npeasantry. They enjoyed some hereditary or state granted rights (either as religious\\ngrants or grants in lieu of their services) over appropriation of land revenue from the\\ndesignated areas. These intermediaries assisted the state in the process of land rev-\\nenue collection. The medieval Indian peasantry was a hard pressed lot. The repres-\\nsive nature of land tax,  demand of share in revenue by intermediaries, frequent natu-\\nral calamities rendered the life of an average peasant dismal and deplorable. Peasant\\nrevolts, therefore, were not altogether unknown during this period.\\n220\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nEconomy\\nTextile, mining and metallurgy, ship-building, construction works, arms and armour\\nmanufacturing, were some of the prominent crafts practised during this period.

It had evolved into\\na well developed movement by the 11th century. Sufis, stress on the importance of\\ntraversing the path of the Sufi pir enabling one to establish a direct communion with\\nthe divine. Sufism or mysticism emerged in the 8th century and among the early known\\nSufis were Rabia al-Adawiya, Al-Junaid and Bayazid Bastami. Fundamental to sufism\\nis God, Man and the relation between them that is Love. They believe that from man\\nemerged the theories of ruh (soul), qurbat (divine proximity) and hulul (infusion of\\nthe divine spirit) and that from relation between God and Man ideas such as Ishq\\n(divine love) and Fana (self annihilation) come into being. The Sufis were regarded\\nas people who kept their heart pure; they sought to communicate with God though\\ntheir ascetic practices and doctrine of divine love and union with God. The murid\\n(disciple) passes through maqamat (various stages) in this process of experiencing\\ncommunication with the divine.\\nThe khanqah (the hospice) was the center of activities of the various sufis orders.\\nThe khanqah was led by shaikh, pir or murshid (teacher) who lived with his mu-\\nrids (disciples). In time the Khanqahs emerged as important centres of learning and\\npreaching. By the twelfth century the sufis were organized in silsilahs (orders). The\\nword silsila meant chain and it represented signifying an unbreakable chain between\\nthe pir and the murid. With the death of the pir his tomb or shrine the dargah\\nbecame a centre for his disciples and followers.\\nIn the 10th century Sufism spread across important regions of the Islamic empire.\\nIran, Khurasan, Transoxiana, Egypt, Syria and Baghdad were important Sufi centers.\\nAl-Ghazali, (1059–1111 A.D.) is among the most venerated of Sufis. He reconciled\\nIslamic mysticism with Islamic orthodoxy, providing Sufi mysticism a secure place in\\nIslam. He stressed on the need for the disciple to follow the guidance of the spiritual\\nmaster. He also emphasised on the supreme authority of the holy Prophet and the\\nneed to obey laws in both letter and spirit\\nThe Sufi movement in India commenced in the 11th century A.D. Al Hujwiri, who\\nestablished himself in north India was buried in Lahore and regarded as the oldest\\nSufi in the sub Continent. Among the important Sufi Orders in the history of Medieval\\nIndia were those of the Chishtitiya, Suhrawardiya, Qadiriya and Naqshbandiya.\\nChisti and the Suhrawardi silsilahs were popular during the Sultanate period. The\\nSuhrawardis were active in Punjab and Sindh while the Chishti’s were active in Delhi,\\nRajasthan and parts of the western gangetic plains. By the end of the sultanate period\\nthey had spread to the eastern regions of the gangetic plain (Bihar and Bengal) and\\ninto the Deccan. During the medieval period the Sufis played an important role in\\ninterpreting and elaborating on Islamic theological concepts like Wahdat ul Wujud\\n(unity of being) and also encouraged the development of practices like Ziyarat (the\\npractice of visiting tombs).\\nThe Sufi movement as it emerged in India had the following features:\\n \\nThe Sufis were organized in a number of different silsilahs (orders)\\n \\nMost of these orders were led by some prominent sufi saint or pir.

He seems to have\\nmoved into India after the invasion of Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghori and subsequently\\nto Ajmer in 1206. The fame of Khwaja Muinuddin grew after his death in 1235, his\\ngrave was visited by Muhammad Tughlaq after which the mosque and dome were\\nerected by Mahmud Khalji of Malwa in the fifteenth century. The patronage of this\\ndargah peaked after the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar.\\nThe Chishtis believed in:\\n \\nlove as the bond between God and individual soul,\\n \\nthe tolerance between people of different faiths,\\n \\nacceptance of disciples irrespective of their religious beliefs,\\n \\nattitude of benevolence to all,\\n \\nassociation with Hindu and Jain yogi’s, and\\n \\nuse of simple language\\nFig. 14.1 Ajmer Durgah\\n227\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nThe Chishti presence in Delhi was established by Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki who\\nsettled in Delhi from his homeland in Transoxiana in 1221. This was at the time of the\\nMongol invasions when there was a steady flow of people from central Asia fleeing\\nfrom the Mongols. His presence in Delhi was a threat to the Suhrawardis who sought\\nto force him to leave by levelling charges against him. The Sultan of Delhi, Itutmish,\\ndismissed these attempts eventually forcing the Suhrawardis to relent. The Chishti\\npirs laid great emphasis on the simplicity of life, poverty, humility and selfless devo-\\ntion to God. The renunciation of worldly possessions was regarded by them as neces-\\nsary for the control of the senses that was necessary to maintain a spiritual life.\\nKhwaja Muinuddin Chishti argued that highest form of devotion to God was to re-\\ndress the misery of those in distress, fulfilling the need of the helpless and to feed the\\nhungry. They refused to accept any grant for their maintenance from the Sultans.\\nThe other important Chishti Baba Fariduddin Ganj-i-Shakar, established himself at\\nHansi (in Haryana) on the route between Multan and Lahore. Nizamuddin Auliya,\\nwas the best known Chishti saint of the Sultanate period. He lived in the fourteenth\\ncentury, during a period of political change and turmoil. During his lifetime he was\\nwitness to the establishment of the Khalji rule after the death of Balban and subse-\\nquently the establishment of the Tughlaq’s. There are numerous stories surrounding\\nthe life of Nizamuddin Auliya, famous among them were stories of his confrontations\\nwith the Sultans of Delhi. The Khwaja is said to have maintained a strict policy of not\\ninvolving himself with the various groups and factions of the Sultan’s court in Delhi\\nearning him the respect of many. Nasiruddin Chiragh Delhi was another of the Chishti\\nsaints of Delhi. He played an active role in the political affairs of the period.\\nAll these enabled Sufis to maintain a loyal and dedicated following.\\nIn the 13th century the Chishti Order was established in the Deccan by Shaikh\\nBurhanuddin Gharib. Between the 14th and 16th centuries many Chishti Sufis mi-\\ngrated to Gulbarga. This was accompanied with a change where some of the Chishtis\\nbegan accepting grants and patronage from the ruling establishment. Muhammad\\nBanda Nawaz is among the famous pirs in the region. The Deccan city of Bijapur\\nemerged as an important centre for Sufi activity.\\nThe Suhrawardi Silsilah\\nThis Silsilah was founded by Shihabuddin Suhrawardi in Baghdad. It was established\\nin India by Bahauddin Zakariya. He founded the Suhrawardi Order, based in Mutan,\\nwhich was under the control of Qubacha. He was critical of Qubacha and openly\\nfavored Iltutmish over his rival. His ways were different from that of the Chishtis. The\\nSuhrawardis, unlike the Chishtis, accepted, maintenance grants from the Sultans. They\\nbelieved that a Sufi should possess the three attributes of property, knowledge and hal\\nor mystical enlightenment. Suhrawardi saints argued that this was necessary to ensure\\nthat they served the poor better. He stressed on the observance or external forms of\\nreligious belief and advocated a combination of ilm (scholarship) with mysticism. Prac-\\ntices like bowing before the sheikh, presenting water to visitors and tonsuring the head\\nat the time of initiation into the Order that the Chishtis had adopted were rejected. After\\nhis death the silsilah continued to play an important role in Punjab and Sindh.\\nNaqshbandi Silsilah\\nIn India this order was established by Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshbandi. From the\\nbeginning the mystics of this Order stressed on the observance of the shariat and\\n228\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\ndenounced all innovations or biddat. Sheikh Baqi Billah the successor to Khawaja\\nBahauddin Naqshbandi settled near Delhi, and his successor Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi\\nattempted to purge Islam from all liberal and what he believed were ‘un-Islamic’ prac-\\ntices. He opposed the listening of sama (religious music) and the practice of pilgrimage\\nto the tombs of saints. He opposed interaction with Hindus and Shias. He criticised the\\nnew status accorded by Akbar to many non-Muslims, the withdrawal of the Jizyah and\\nthe ban on cow slaughter. He believed that he was the mujaddid (renewer) of the first\\nmillennium of Islam. He maintained that the relationship between man and God was that\\nbetween the slave and the master and not the relation of a lover and beloved. He\\nemphasised the individual’s unique relation of faith and responsibility to God as creator.\\nHe tried to harmonise the doctrines of mysticism and the teachings of orthodox Islam.\\nThe Qadri Silsilah\\nThe Quadiriyya silsilah was popular in Punjab. Sheikh Abdul Qadir and his sons\\nwere supporters of the Mughals under Akbar. The pirs of this Order supported the\\nconcept of Wahdat al Wajud. Among the famous Sufis of this order was Miyan Mir\\nwho had enrolled the Mughal princess Jahanara and her brother Dara as disciples.\\nThe influence of the sheikh’s teachings is evident in the works of the prince. Shah\\nBadakhshani another pir of this silsilah while dismissing orthodox elements, declared\\nthat, the infidel who had perceived reality and recognised it was a believer and that a\\nbeliever who did not recognise reality was an infidel.\\nDuring medieval period there was constant tension between the liberal and orthodox\\nviews in Islam. The sufis featured on both sides, while there were those like the\\nChishtis who held a liberal view and argued in favour of assimilation of local traditions\\nthere were others like sheikh Abdul Haqq of the Qadiriyya silsilah who held the view\\nthat the purity of Islam was being diluted. This Orthodox view was represented by the\\nulema that argued from the perspective of being upholders of the shariat.

It was in south India that it\\ngrew from a religious tradition into a popular movement based on religious equality\\nand broad based social participation. The movement led by popular saints reached its\\nclimax in the 10th century A.D. In its attempt to embrace the concept of bhakti the\\nmovement in different regions drew from diverse traditions and assumed different\\nforms in different parts of the sub continent.\\nThe bhakti movement attempted to break away from orthodox Brahmanism. The\\nmovement gathered momentum in the early medieval period.

They argue that the Turkish conquest paved the way for a\\nreaction against the conformist Rajput-Brahman domination. The rise of bhakti move-\\nment is considered by some scholars as a reaction against feudal oppression. The anti\\nfeudal tone in the poetry of bhakti saints like Kabir, Nanak, Chaitanya and Tulsidas\\nare seen as illustrations of this point. There is no single opinion about the origins of the\\nbhakti movement that can be sustained. It is clear from the poetry and the philosophy\\nof the bhakti saints that they broke away from orthodox Brahmanism. They believed\\nin religious equality and identified themselves with the sufferings of the common people.\\nSome scholars feel that the socio economic changes in the early medieval period\\nprovide the necessary backdrop to understand the emergence of the Bhakti move-\\nment. During the 13th and 14th centuries the demand for manufactured goods, luxuries\\nand other artisanal goods increased leading to a movement of artisans into the cities.\\nThe artisans were attracted to bhakti because of its ideas of equality. These groups\\nwere dissatisfied with the low status accorded to them by Brahmanical system. The\\nmovement gained support from these classes of society. There were also a few varia-\\ntions in places like Punjab where not only Khatris but Jat peasants as were also\\nattracted to this movement.\\nThe bhakti movement in the early medieval period represents an important movement\\nof reform and change. After the rise of heterodox movements of the 6th century BC the\\nbhakti movement represents another phase of Indian history in which new ideas and\\npractices emerged influencing the country as a whole initiating reform movements.\\nThe Bhakti movement in north India\\nThe bhakti movement in the north included socio religious movements that were linked to\\none of the acharyas from the south and is sometimes seen as a continuation of the move-\\nment that originated in the south. Though there were similarities in the traditions of the two\\nregions, the notion of bhakti varied in the teachings of each of the saints. The Nirguna\\nBhaktas like Kabir rejected the varnaashrama and all conventions based on caste distinc-\\ntion and championed new values, helping the emergence of new groups and new unortho-\\ndox/protestant sects. The Saguna Bhaktas like Tulsidas on the other hand upheld the caste\\nsystem and the supremacy of the Brahmins. They preached religion of surrender and\\nsimple faith in a personal god and had a strong commitment to idol worship.\\nMonotheistic Bhakti\\nKabir (c.1440–1518 A.D.) was the earliest and most influential Bhakti saint in north\\nIndia. He was a weaver. He spent a large part of his life in Banaras. His poems were\\nincluded in the Sikh scripture, the Adi Granth. Among those who were influenced by\\nKabir were Raidas, who was a tanner by caste from Banaras, Guru Nanak who was\\na Khatri from Punjab and Dhanna who was a Jat peasant from Rajasthan.\\n230\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\nThere are similarities in the teachings of the various monotheistic Bhakti saints in\\nNorth India.\\n \\nMost of the monotheists belonged to the low castes and were aware that there\\nexisted a unity in their ideas. They were also aware of each other’s teachings\\nand influence. In their verses they mention each other and their predecessors in\\na manner suggesting ideological affinity among them.\\n \\nAll of them were influenced by the Vaishnava concept of Bhakti, the Nathpanthi\\nmovement and Sufism. Their ideas seem to be a synthesis of the three traditions.\\n \\nThe importance given to the personal experience of Bhakti saint with God was another\\ncommon feature among the monotheistic bhakti saints. Nirguna bhakti and not saguna\\nbhakti was what they believed in. They had adopted the notion of bhakti from vaishnavaism\\nbut they gave it a nirguna orientation. Though they called God using different names and\\ntitles their God was non-incarnate, formless, eternal and ineffable.\\n \\nThe Bhakti saints refused any formal association with the organized dominant\\nreligions of the time (Hinduism and Islam) and criticized what they regarded to\\nbe the negative aspects of these religions. They rejected the authority of the\\nBrahmans and attacked the caste system and practice of idolatry.\\n \\nThey composed their poems in popular languages and dialects spoken across\\nnorth India. This enabled them to transmit their ideas among the masses. It helped\\ntheir ideas to spread rapidly among the various lower classes.\\nVaishnava Bhakti\\nIn the 14th and early 15th centuries Ramananda emerged as a popular vaishnava bhakti\\nsaint in north India. Though he was from the south he lived in Banaras because he\\nconsidered it to be the link between the South Indian bhakti and North Indian vaishnava\\nbhakti traditions. He looked upon Ram and not Vishnu as the object of bhakti. He\\nworshiped Ram and Sita and came to be identified as the founder of the Ram cult in\\nnorth India. He like the monotheist bhakti saints also rejected cast hierarchies and preached\\nin the local languages in his attempt to popularize the cult. His followers are called\\nRamanandis. Tulsidas also championed the bhakti cause. In the early 16 century\\nVallabacharya, a popular bhakti saint popularized the Krishna bhakti. Among those who\\nfollowed in his footsteps were Surdas (1483–1563) and Mira Bai (1503–1573).\\nThe vaishnava bhakti movement in Bengal was very different form its counterparts in\\nnorth India and the south. It was influenced by the vaishnava bhakti tradition of the\\nBhagavata purana and the Sahajiya Buddhist and Nathpanthi traditions. These tradi-\\ntions focused on esoteric and emotional aspects of devotion. In the 12th century,\\nJayadeva was an important bhakti saint in this tradition. He highlighted the mystical\\ndimension of love with reference to Krishna and Radha. Chaitanya was a popular\\nbhakti saint from the region; he was looked upon as an avatara of Krishna. Though,\\nhe did not question the authority of the Brahmans and the scriptures. He also popular-\\nized the sankirtan (group devotional songs accompanied with ecstatic dancing). With\\nhim the bhakti movement in Bengal began to develop into a reform movement with\\nthe notions of caste divisions that came to be questioned.\\nIn Maharashtra the bhakti movement drew its inspiration from the Bhagavata purana\\nand the Siva Nathpanthis. Jnaneswar was a pioneer bhakti saint of Maharashtra. His\\ncommentary on the Bhagavad Gita called Jnanesvari served as a foundation of the\\n231\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nbhakti ideology in Maharashtra. Arguing against caste distinctions he believed that\\nthe only way to attain God was through Bhakti. Vithoba was the God of this sect and its\\nfollowers performed a pilgrimage to the temple twice a year. The Vithoba of Pandarpur\\nbecame the mainstay of the movement in Maharashtra. Namdev (1270–1350) was\\nanother important bhakti saint from Maharashtra. While he is remembered in the north\\nIndian monotheistic tradition as a nirguna saint, in Maharashtra he is considered to be\\npart of the varkari tradition (the vaishnava devotional tradition). Some of the other\\nimportant bhakti saints of Maharashtra were the saints Choka, Sonara, Tukaram and\\nEknath. Tukaram’s teachings are in the form of the Avangas (dohas), which constitute\\nthe Gatha, while Eknath’s teachings that were in Marathi attempted to shift the empha-\\nsis of Marathi literature from spiritual to narrative compositions.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 14.2\\n1.\\nThe Bhakti movement attempted to break away from which system?\\n2.\\nName any three important Bhakti Saints?\\n3.\\nWho was Chaitanya?\\n14.3 SIKHISM\\nThe teachings and philosophy of Guru Nanak form an important part of Indian philo-\\nsophical thought. His philosophy consists of three basic elements: a leading charis-\\nmatic personality (the Guru), ideology (Shabad) and Organization (Sangat). Nanak\\nevaluated and criticized the prevailing religious beliefs and attempted to establish a\\ntrue religion, which could lead to salvation. He repudiated idol worship and did not\\nfavour pilgrimage nor accept the theory of incarnation. He condemned formalism and\\nritualism. He laid emphasis on having a true Guru for revelation. He advised people to\\nfollow the principles of conduct and worship: sach (truth), halal (lawful earning),\\nkhair (wishing well of others), niyat (right intention) and service to the lord. He\\n Fig 14.2 Guru Nanak\\n232\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\ndenounced the caste system and the inequality it caused. He argued that the caste and\\nhonour should be judged by the acts or the deeds of individuals. He laid stress on con-\\ncepts of justice, righteousness and liberty. His verses mainly consist of two basic con-\\ncepts, Sach (truth) and Nam (name). The bases of the divine expression for him were\\nformed by, the Sabad (the word), Guru (the divine precept) and Hukam (the divine\\norder). He introduced the concept of Langar (a community kitchen). Guru Nanak iden-\\ntifies himself with the people or the ruled. Though the Sikh guru’s stressed on equality\\nthe social differentiation among the followers continued. It was only towards the end of\\nthe 17th century that Guru Gobind Singh reasserted the idea of equality. In 1699 Guru\\nGobind Singh attempted to resolve the differences among the various Sikh groups and\\ncreated the Khalsa. This institution removed the masands as intermediaries. Thereafter\\nevery Sikh was to have a direct link with the Guru. To create a sense of unity among the\\nSikhs the Guru started some practices which were to be followed by Sikhs. These were\\ninitiation through the baptism of the double edged sword, wearing uncut hair, carrying\\narms, adopting the epithet Singh as part of the name.\\nThe idea of Guru Panth was another institutional idea that emerged during this period.\\nIt sanctified the collective authority of the Khalsa Panth, which equated the Panth\\nwith the Guru. Guru Nanak in his last days had nominated a successor and paid\\nhomage to him, this gave rise to the idea that the Guru and the Sikh were interchange-\\nable. This created a problem for the institution of the Sangat (that was a collective\\nbody of the Sikhs) in which God was said to be present. When Guru Gobind Singh\\ncreated the Khalsa he chose the panj piyare (the five beloved) and requested them to\\nadminister the pahul (amrit chakhha) to him. With this the difference between the\\nGuru and the Khalsa was symbolically removed. Guru Gobind Singh is believed to\\nhave said that the Khalsa is his own roop (form).\\nGuru Nanak was from the Khatri mercantile caste whereas his followers were mostly\\nrural Jats. It was Guru Gobind Singh who inaugurated the Khalsa among the Sikhs.\\nGuru Arjan compiled the Guru Granth Sahib. After the death of Guru Gobind Singh\\nthe tenth Guru the tradition of guru ended. It was believed that the spirit of the guru\\ndid not pass onto any successor but instead remained within “Shri Gurugranth Sahib”.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 14.3\\n1.\\nWhat do you understand from the term Khalsa?\\n2.\\nWho were Khatris?\\n14.4 LITERATURE AND LANGUAGES\\nSanskrit literature\\nThe medieval period witnessed the growth of a rich corpus of literature that accom-\\npanied the development of new languages. The conventional view among historians\\nwas that the patronage of the Sanskrit language had declined because the establish-\\nment of the Delhi Sultanate led to the patronage of Persian. But this period witnessed\\nthe growth of a rich corpus of Sanskrit literature. This period is marked with compo-\\nsition of poetical works called the Kavya (poetical narrative) and the texts that codi-\\nfied laws called the Dhramashastras.\\n233\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nDuring the first half of the medieval period Sanskrit received patronage from the\\nnumerous smaller political establishments in central and south India. In western India\\nHemachandra Suri was an important Jain scholar who composed works in Sanskrit,\\nas was Chaitanya. There were also many dramas written during this period. A new\\nstyle of writing called the champu also emerged during this period. It was a form that\\nmixed both prose and poetry. Among the Sanskrit works that were written with the\\npatronage of the Rajput kings were their family histories like the Prithvirajavijaya\\nand the Hammirmahakavya. Among the historical poems of the period was the\\nRajavinoda that was a biography of Sultan Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat written by\\nhis court poet, Udayaraja. Another important work was Kalhan’s Rajtarangini, which\\npresented a history of the kings of Kashmir. It was written in the 12th century A.D.\\nThe second Rajtaranginni was written by Jonaraja who wrote the history of the\\nkings of Kashmir from Jayasimha to Sultan Zainul Abidin and the third was written by\\nSrivara who wrote the history of the region till 1486. Apart from these there were the\\nprabandhas which were semi historical texts written during the period.\\nAfter the 15th century the patronage of the Sanskrit language was maintained in the\\nsouthern courts of the rulers of Vijayanagar, Nayakas of Tanjor and the chiefs of\\nTravancore and Cochin. The various genres of Sanskrit literature like Mahakavyas,\\nSlesh Kavyas, Champu Kavyas, Natakas and the historical Kavyas continued. Among\\nthe important writers of this period were Govinda Dikshita (Sahitya Sudha and\\nSangitsudhanidhi being among his important works); Appaya Dikshita (in the court\\nof the Nayaka ruler of Vellore); Nilanatha Dikshit (who was a minister in the court of\\nthe Nayaka of Madurai); Chakrakavi (who was patronized by the rulers of Kozhikode).\\nThe historical Kavyas gave a glimpse not just of the exploits of the various rulers but\\nalso a glimpse of the social perception of the writers. Some of the Mughals like Dara\\nShukoh also came to be mentioned in these Kavyas. The Mughal prince is also cred-\\nited with the composition of a prasasti in honour of Nrisimha Sarasvati of Benaras.\\nThere were also a few works composed in the courts of the rulers of Bijapur and\\nGolconda, but Sanskrit literature during this period began to decline.\\nPersian literature\\nWith the establishment of the Delhi sultanate a new language and literary style was\\nintroduced into the sub continent.\\nThe development of Persian literature in the sub continent entered a new era in the\\nwritings of Amir Khusrau. He was a poet born in a family of Turkish immigrants and\\nbegan as a poet in the reign of Sultan Balban. He was a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya\\nand was patronized in the courts of Jalaluddin Khalji, Alauddin Khalji and Ghiyasuddin\\nTughluq. He is said to have composed ninety-nine works on different themes and\\nnumerous verses of poetry. His poetry was written in the different forms of lyric, ode,\\nepic and elegy. His writing style represents the first instance of Persian styles being\\ncomposed in the Indian context. This came to be known as the Sabaq-i-Hindi (the\\nIndian style). Among the important works composed by him are, Mutla-ul-Anwar,\\nShirin Khusrau, Laila Majnun and Ayina-I-Sikandari, these works were dedi-\\ncated to Alauddin Khalji. Amorig his five Diwans (Ghazals) are Tuhfat-us-Sighar,\\nBaqiya Naqiya and Nihayat-ul-Kamal. He also wrote masnavis (narrative poems),\\nwhich have been of great historical and literary value. Among these are the Qiran-us\\nSa’dain, Miftah-ul Futuh (dealing with the military success of Jalauddin Khalji),\\nTughluq Nama (describing Ghiyasuddin Tughluq’s rise to power) and the\\n234\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\nKhazain-ul Futuh (giving an account of Alauddin Khalji’s conquest of the South). Among\\nthe other important Persian poets was Shaikh Najmuddin Hasan who was also one of the\\npoets in the court of Alauddin Khalji. His ghazals earned him the title, S’aid of Hindustan.\\nThe court chronicles were an important feature of the literature during the period of\\nthe Delhi Sultanate. Some important of these were, the Tabaqat-I-Nasiri by Minaj-us\\nSiraj, Futuh-us Salatin by Isami and the Futuhat-I Firozshahi by Feroz Shah Tughluq.\\nZiauddin Barani made the most important contribution to Persian literature during this\\nperiod. The Tarikh-I Firozshahi and the Fatwa-I Jahandari are his important works.\\nThe Sufi literature of the period developed a new form called the malfuzat that was in\\nthe form of a dialogue of the Sufi saints. The most famous of these was the Fawaid-ul\\nFu’ad written by Amir Hassan Sijzi containing the anecdotes of the Shaikh Nizamuddin\\nAuliya and Khair-ul-Majalis containing the anecdotes of Sheik Nasiruddin Mahmud.\\nDuring this period there were many works that were translated into Persian. The Tuti\\nNama (book of the parrot) by Zia Nakshabi was the first Persian translation of Sanskrit\\nstories. The Mahabharatha and the Rajtarangini were also translated into Persian\\nduring this period. The number of translations of Sanskrit works into Persian grew\\nduring the reigns of Feroz Tughluq and Sikandar Lodi.\\nLike that of the sultanate, Persian also continued as the official language of the Mughal\\ncourt. The Mughal rulers and princes also maintained a tradition of writing. The first\\nMughal emperor Babur, himself a literary figure, wrote his memoirs in Turkish which was\\nsubsequently translated into Persian by Abdur Rahim Khan Khanan. Humayun composed\\na Persian diwan. Prince Dara Shukoh wrote a biographical account of the Sufi saint Miya\\nMir and his disciples in the Sakinatul Auliya. He also wrote the Majm’aul Bahrain\\n(Mingling of two Oceans). There was a new genre of Persian literature known as the\\nSabaq-i-Hindi (the Indian style) created during this period by the Persian poets visiting\\nand living in the sub continent. Writers like Faizi, Urfi, Talib, Ghani Kashmiri and Bedil\\nwere among those who benefited from the patronage they received from the Mughals.\\nAmong the important works of Faizi was Tabashir al Sabh. He also authored many\\ntranslations of Hindu religious books. Abdur Rahim Khan Khana a talented scholar\\nand poet lived during the reign of Akbar and Jahangir. Akbar patronized great scholar\\nhistorian Abul Fazl. He is said to have maintained a library of more than four thousand\\nbooks. He is known for the patronage he extended to many writers of the period. The\\npoets Ali Quli Salem and Abu Talib Kalim were important poets during the reign of\\nShah Jahan. The latter is said to have authored the Padshahnama. Persian literature\\nin the south received patronage from the Adil Shahi rulers of Bijapur, here Malik\\nQummi and Mulla Zuhuri were regarded as important Persian poets. The Qutab Shahis\\nof Golconda patronized poets like Muhammad Hussain Tabrezi. The development of\\nPersian literature in the Mughal court played an important role and influenced the\\ndevelopment and growth of regional literature. Languages like Punjabi, Pushtu, Sindhi\\nand Kashmiri were strongly influenced by Persian.\\nGrowth and Development of Regional Languages\\nThe growth of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, \\nAssamese, Oriya, Marathi and Gujarati\\nduring the medieval period was an important development. These languages can be traced\\nto the 7th and 8th centuries when they seem to have broken away from their Prakrit base.\\nIn the south Malayalam emerged as an independent language in the 14th century. The\\ngrowth of these regional languages coincided with a growing regional sentiment and the\\nemergence of regional polities. This resulted in the decline of Sanskrit that was being\\nreplaced by Persian and some of these regional languages as a medium through which the\\n235\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nadministrative machinery functioned. The rise of the Bhakti movement and its propagation\\nusing these languages also enabled the growth and development of these languages.\\nHindi and Urdu\\nRegional dialects like Braj bhasa, Haryanvi and other dialects spoken in regions around\\nDelhi and Punjab influenced the development of Urdu during its formative stage. The\\nbasic structure of the language consisted of Khari Boli (a mixture of various dialects\\nspoken in the region mentioned above). The language adopted the Persian script and\\nliterary tradition. The word Urdu is of Turkish origin referring to an army or camp. It\\nseems to have been a language that emerged from the dialect spoken in the Turkish\\ncamp between officials and the soldiers. Hindivi is said to be the language out of which\\nUrdu and Hindi eventually developed. The works of Amir Khusrau are regarded to\\nhave laid the foundations of this language. The use of this language in the Deccan from\\nthe 14th century onwards led to a literary speech called the Dakhni. The major centres\\nof this language were Gujarat, Bijapur, Golconda, Bidar and Aurangabad. The oldest\\nwriter of this tradition was Sayyid Banda Nawaz Gesudaraz who was an important Sufi\\nin the Bahmani kingdom. The sultan of Bijapur, Ibrahim Adil Shah II himself was a great\\npatron and author of a book on music in the Dakhni language.\\nHindi evolved during the Apabhransa stage between the 7th – 8th centuries and the\\n14th century. It was characterized as Veergatha Kala (age of heroic poetry) or the\\nAdi Kala (early Period). The various Rajput rulers patronized these poems written in\\nthe rajasthani dialect of Hindi and that glorified chivalry and bravery. Among the\\nfamous works are the Prithviraja Raso of Chand Bardai, and other poems like the\\nVisaldeva Raso and Hammir Raso. The authenticity of many of these works is\\ndoubted because of the various interpolations made to the original draft. There are\\nother works of Buddhists and Jains that can be ascribed to this period.\\nThe development of the Hindi language underwent another transformation during the 14th\\nand the 15 centuries with the increasing use of the language in expressing Bhakti traditions\\nand ideas. Kabir adopted a style called the ultabasi, which consisted of paradoxes and\\nenigmas. While bhakti saints like Tulsidas used the Awadhi dialect of Hindi others like Mira\\nBai used the Marwari dialect of Rajasthan and Surdas used Braj bhasha. The Sufi saints\\nalso used the development of the new dialects as a medium to reach out to a larger audience.\\nWhile the Chishti saints used Hindi while composing and singing their devotional music.\\nBengali\\nThe folksongs called Charyapads composed between the 10 and 12th centuries are\\nthe earliest specimen of the Bengali language. The works of Kavindra and Srikaranandi\\nare regarded to be among the important early works in Bengali. The growth of the\\nBhakti movement and the composition of various hymns associated with Chaitanya\\nfurther provided a stimulus to the development of this language. Brindabandas’s\\nChaitanya Bhagavata or Chaitanya Mangal was one such contribution to Bengali\\nliterature that not only gave a valuable account of the saint’s death a decade later but\\nis also regarded as being reflective of the social condition prevailing at that time. The\\nChaitanya-Charitamrita by Krishnadas Kaviraj was another important account.\\nLochandas is associated with the introduction of a new style of folk songs called\\nDhamali. Narrative poems called the Mangal Kavyas also grew popular during this\\nperiod. They propagated the importance of local deities like Chandi and transformed\\nPuranic gods like Siva and Vishnu into household deities. The narrative form of the\\nMangal Kavyas was derived from the Puranas.\\n236\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\nAsamese and Oriya\\nThe 13th century works of Hema Sarasvati Prahladacharita and Hara Gauri Samyada\\nare regarded as the first works in Assamese. The literature in Assam also developed\\nin response to the bhakti movement. Shankaradeva who introduced Vaisnavism in\\nAssam also helped stimulate the growth of Assamese poetry. His disciple, Madhavadas\\nwrote the Bhakti-ratnvali dealing with aspects of bhakti and the Baragitas that\\ndepicted the life of Krishna in Vrindavan. There were also translations of the Puranas\\ninto Assamese. In Orissa the works of Saraladasa are regarded as the first works of\\nOriya literature. There were numerous kavyas composed on Puranic themes by\\nMadhusudana, Bhima and Sasasiva. The Rasa Kallol written during this period also\\ndeals on the theme of the love between Radha and Krishna. Other important works\\nare the Ushabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Dasa and the Rukminibibha of Kartik Dasa. The\\nworks of Upendra Bhanja (1670–1720) were important as they ushered a new era of\\nOriya literature in the succeeding period.\\nLiterature in South India\\nIn the south Villiputturar was an important literary figure of the period. The tradition\\nof using Sanskrit words and literary expressions is ascribed to him. Other important\\nworks in Tamil are commentaries written by Vaishnava scholars and also commen-\\ntaries on works of the sangam age like the Tolkappiyam and the Kural. There were\\nalso a number of philosophical works and commentaries that were written on the\\nPuranas. Many of the works in Tamil literature were related to Shaivism and\\nVaishnavism. Among the important works of the medieval period was the Irusamaya-\\nvilakkam written by Haridasa, the Sivadarumottaram and the Saiva Samayaneri\\nboth written by Marainanarbandar. In the realm of philosophy the notable works were\\nthe Cidambarapuranam (1508) by Purana Tirumalainathan and the\\nPalanittalapuranam by Balasubramanya Kavirayar.\\nDuring this period the most famous Telugu poet was Errapragada who popularized\\nthe Champu genre of literary writing (mixed form of verse and prose). He also trans-\\nlated the Bhagavata Purana into Telugu. The Vijayanagar ruler Krishnadeva Raya\\nwrote the Amuktamalyada in Telugu. The most celebrated poet in his court was\\nAllarrani Peddana and Nandi Timmaha who wrote the Parijatapaharana. Bhattumurti\\nor Rama Raja Bhushan is known for the Vasucaritra and the Hariscandra\\nNalopakhyanam (that narrates the story of Nala and Raja Harishchandra). In the\\nKannada speaking regions Jain writers dominated the literary compositions of the\\nperiod. The works of Basava and his followers who popularized the Virasaiva move-\\nment in the region also form an important aspect of Kannada literature. The patron-\\nage of the Hoysala rulers further helped the development of the language. The Vadi\\nVidyananda of Geroppa is an anthology of Kannada poets. The Jain scholar Salva\\nwrote works like the Trilokararara (on cosmology), Aparajiyasataka (on Philoso-\\nphy) and the Bharataesvaracarita (the story of the famous king Bharata). Malayalam\\nemerged as an independent language during this period. The language was in oral\\nform and the earliest work composed in the 14th century was the Rama Charitam.\\nThe works of Rama Panikkar who wrote Bharata Gatha, Savitri Mahatmyam and\\nthe Bhagavatam are considered important in malayalam.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 14.4\\n1.\\nName any two important texts written in Sanskrit?\\n237\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\n2.\\nWhat is a ‘Kavya’?\\n3.\\nWho was Amir Khusrau?\\n4.\\nName the two important works of Ziauddin Barani?\\n5.\\nWhat do you understand by the term Sabaq-i- Hindi?\\n6.\\nName any  four regional languages that developed during the Medieval Period?\\n14.5 MUSIC\\nInformation on music of the sultanate period is limited. The important phase in the\\ndevelopment of music during this period belongs to the time of Amir Khusrau. It is\\nduring this period that the qawwali style is said to have developed. He is also credited\\nfor the development of many modern ragas like aiman, gora and sanam. He is\\ncredited with the creation of a new musical instrument, the sitar that was a combina-\\ntion of the Indian vina and the Iranian tambura. The Turks are credited with bringing\\nmusical instruments like rabab and sarangi into South Asia. In Vrindavan Swami\\nHaridas promoted music and is considered to have taught Tansen who was at the\\ncourt of the Mughal emperor Akbar. Tansen is regarded as an important exponent of\\nthe Hindustani classical music and is credited with introducing ragas as the Miyan ki\\nMalhar, Miyan ki Todi and Darbari. Raja Mansingh is said to have played an impor-\\ntant role in the perfection of the Dhrupad style of North Indian Music. In the south a\\nsystem of ragas known as the Janaka and Janya ragas existed during this period. The\\nSwaramela Kalanidhi by Ramamatya of Kondavidu written in 1550 describes 20\\nJanan and 64 Janya ragas. By the 18th century several new forms of music like\\nTarana, Dadra and Ghazal had come into existence.\\n14.6 PAINTINGS\\nThe developments in painting during the sultanate period have not been studied be-\\ncause of the limited samples. The closest view that one has of murals in the sultanate\\nis to the numerous literary references. The earliest reference to murals is in a qasida\\nin praise of Iltutmish, which describes the figures depicted upon the sqandrels of the\\nmain arch that was raised to welcome the envoy of the Caliph. In another reference\\nin the Tarikh-I Ferozshai there is a reference to the Sultan seeking to ban the tradi-\\ntion of figural paintings on the walls of the palaces of Delhi. Quaranic calligraphy also\\nbecame popular across South Asia during this period. The earliest copy of the Quran\\n(dated 1399) was written in Gwalior. The manuscript was decorated with a variety of\\nornamental motifs. By the 15th century the kingdoms of Gujarat, Malwa and Jaunpur\\nemerged as important centres of art.\\nPaintings in medieval India entered a new phase under the Mughals. They altered the\\ncharacter of painting across north India. The Mughal paintings are defined by the\\nstyles and subjects popular at the imperial court. The early origins of the Mughal\\nSchool of painting can be traced to Kabul. During the reign of Humayun two Persian\\nartists, Mir Syed Ali and Abdus Samad were patronized.\\n238\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\nAkbar deputed them to illustrate manuscript of Hamzanama. This manuscript of\\n1,400 pages was compiled by artists drawn from Gwalior, Gujarat, Lahore and Kash-\\nmir. It is during this period that many features of Mughal painting developed. Many\\npaintings of this period are collaborative efforts with two or even four painters work-\\ning on one painting. Among the important features of the paintings of this period are\\nrestricted movement of the figures, fineness of lines of drawings and flat depiction of\\narchitectural columns. The Mughal paintings are also marked with a naturalism and\\nrhythm, the clothing of the objects assumed Indian forms and the use of subsidiary\\nscenes in the background. The two most common themes in Mughal paintings of this\\nperiod are specific events in the court and the portraits of leading personalities.\\nDuring the reign of Jahangir there were other changes in the style of Mughal paintings.\\nThe paintings of the Jahangir period accentuate a formalist style and have broad mar-\\ngins which are well decorated with the depiction of flora and faces of human figures,\\nthe naturalistic representations matured during the reign of Jahangir. The use of trees,\\nbirds, streams and rivers in the backdrop of the paintings became very popular.\\nFig. 14.3 Mughal Painting\\n239\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nThere are interesting scenes of love and portraits of women members attached to the\\nroyal court in Mughal paintings of the Shah Jahan period, while the paintings of the \\nAurangzeb\\nperiod provide glimpses of the Mughal emperor during his campaigns.

The Rajput paintings during the\\n16th and 17th centuries used many representations of mythology and of court scenes.\\nThe Rajput paintings are spread over a larger geographical region, with each region\\nforming a separate sub topic in the artistic scheme. The other styles that were popular\\nwere the regional styles of the Deccan and the regions of Bengal, Gujarat and Orissa.\\nThe Rajput paintings further flourished in the eighteenth century when many of the\\nartists shifted to the courts of their new patrons. This also coincided with the emer-\\ngence of many smaller regional styles of paintings. These paintings are known for the\\nintensity of the colours that they use and depict hunting scenes, portraits of individuals\\nand of musical sessions. The main styles of this painting were the Mewar, Bundi and\\nthe Kishangarh schools.\\nFig. 14.4 Rajput Painting\\n240\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 14.5\\n1.\\nName the Musical instrument created by Amir Khusrau?\\n2.\\nWho played an important role in the development of the dhrupad style?\\n3.\\nWhat were the stylistic changes in Mughal Paintings seen during the reign of\\nJahangir?\\n4.\\nMention a few popular themes in Mughal Miniatures?\\n14.7 ARCHITECTURE\\nArchitecture of the Delhi Sultanate\\nNew architectural forms and styles were introduced in India during the medieval period.\\nThe arch and dome were new architectural additions of the period. The use of lime-mortar\\nin the construction of buildings and houses altered the building techniques. The develop-\\nment of the true arch was important feature of the architectural style of the period. The\\ntrue arch required stones and bricks to be laid as voussoirs in the shape of a curve and\\nbound together firmly by a good binding material. The arches were made in different\\nshapes but the dominant one was the pointed form. In the 14th century a variant of the\\narch, called the four-centred arch was introduced by the Tughluqs in their buildings.\\nThere are only a few instances of early Turkish buildings in the sub continent where\\nnewly quarried material has been employed. In most of the buildings of the period the\\nrichly carved capitals, columns and shafts of older buildings are reused. Stone has\\nbeen used abundantly in the masonry work of this period. The material commonly\\nused for plastering buildings was gypsum. Apparently lime-plaster was reserved for\\nplaces that needed to be secured against water leakage as in roofs, canals and drains.\\nIn the later period gypsum mortar became popular in buildings.\\nHere we will provide you a brief account of medieval architecture during the Sultan-\\nate Mughal and the regional styles which developed in India during medieval period.\\nFig 14.5 Qutab Minar & Alai Darwaja\\n241\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nThe Sultanate Period\\nMonuments like the Quwwatul Islam mosque (1198), Qutab Minar (1199–1235),\\nAdhai Din Ka Jhonpra (1200) and Iltutmish’s tomb represent the early forms of Indo-\\nIslamic architecture. The early buildings show signs of being worked upon by local crafts-\\nmen while the later buildings show the development or the maturing of the Indo-Islamic\\nstyle. In these monuments one can see the gradual development of dome and the true\\narch. The best examples of this are the tombs of Iltutmish (1233–34) and Balban (1287–\\n88). The Alai Darwaza in the Qutub complex (1305) and the Jamat Khana Masjid at\\nNizamuddin (1325) are examples of Khalji period. Here one notices changes marked by\\nthe distinct influence of the Seljuq architectural tradition. The employment of the true arch\\nshaped like a pointed horse shoe; the emergence of true dome; use of red sand stone and\\ndecorative marble reliefs; the emergence of the lotus bud fringe on the underside of the\\narch and the new masonry were the important features of this new style. The new\\narchitectural style of the Tughluq period is represented with the use of stone rubble as the\\nprinciple building material, the battering of walls and bastions, a new type of arch called\\nthe four centred arch, the emergence of the pointed dome and the introduction of an\\noctagonal plan of tomb building. Another important feature of Tughlaq architecture was\\nthe “batter” or sloping walls. This gave the structures an effcct of strength. During the\\nsubsequent period numerous tombs were built using the octagonal plan while others were\\nbuilt using the square plan. The Architectural monuments of the Sur’s can be divided into\\ntwo periods, the first with buildings at Sasaram (1530–40) like the tombs of Sher Shah’s\\nfather and Sher Shah himself. The second phase from (1540–45) is represented by build-\\nings like the Purana Qila in Delhi and the Qilai Kuhna Masjid inside the Qila. The slight\\nflatness in the curve towards the crown is indicative of the last stage before the develop-\\nment of the four-centred arch developed during the Mughal phase.\\nRegional Variations\\nDuring this period there was a development of various regional architectural forms. In\\neastern India there was the development of two distinctive schools in Bengal and in\\nJaunpur. The most prominent buildings of the Bengal school belong to the Malda district in\\nthe remains of the two cities, Gaur and Pandua. Here there is an introduction of two\\nimportant features. The first was the ‘drop arch’, which had a span greater than its radius\\nand centres at the import level. The second was the method of raising the roof in a system\\nof arched bays where small domes supported by diagonally arranged brick pendentives\\nthat helped transition from a square to a circular base. Another development in this period\\nwas the transition from constructing bamboo houses to brick structures, during which a\\nspecial form of a curved roof developed. The best illustrations of the architecture styles\\nfrom Jaunpur are the mosques. The styles here bear close resemblance to the Tughlaq\\nstyle. The use of the arch and beam are notable features of this style.\\nIn western India the development of regional architectural forms is notable in 14th century\\nGujarat. Here there is a distinctive change in the art form from the 14th into the 15thcentury.\\nIn the former there was a large scale use of building material from demolished temples and\\nin the latter there is a development of a new style in which the layout of the mosques copied\\nthe architectural imprint of temples. In central India the development of new art forms is\\nnoticeable in the Malwa region; the cities of Dhar and Mandu are illustrations of this style.\\nAnother important region that developed its distinctive style was the Deccan where\\nthe Bahmani kingdom created a very different architectural style as compared to the\\nnorthern architectural forms. The Deccan style developed with the fusion of the\\nTughlaq style from the north and the Iranian style. The development of the\\n242\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\narchitectural style here coincides with the shifting of the kingdom’s capital from\\nGulbarga (1347) to Bidar (1425) and eventually to Golconda (1512). In the first phase\\nin Gulbarga the architectural style is representative of a distinctive Islamic architec-\\nture that followed the Tughlaq style. In the second phase there is an adaptation of\\nIranian architectural styles, this is accompanied with the use of coloured tiles, mural\\npaintings and a change in the shape of the domes.\\nAnother important regional development in the Deccan was Vijayanagara art. The\\ndistinctive style is best illustrated using the architectural forms in the city of Hampi.\\nBesides palaces and temples the city also had an extensive network of waterworks and\\npublic buildings such as the elephant stables and the Lotus Mahal. The unique features\\nof this style were the use of pillars for architectural and decorative purposes. The\\nclimax of temple architecture at Vijayanagara occurred under the Tuluva rulers. The\\narchitectural tradition was accompanied by a vibrant sculptural tradition that used many\\nmythological figures and narratives. The shrines on Hemakuta hill, Virupaksha temple\\nand the Hazara Rama temple are examples of Vijayanagara temple architecture.\\nThe Architecture of the Mughal Empire\\nThis period witnessed large scale architectural activities that represented the peak of\\nIslamic art in India. It was also a period where there was a great exchange of ideas\\nand styles that led to the creation of a style that was very different from the Sultanate\\nperiod and that had many features of local or regional styles. The Mughal Emperor\\nAkbar initiated the grand projects that symbolize this period.\\nAmong the early structures of this period are the two mosques built by Babur at\\nSambhal and Panipat in 1526. Babur is also credited with the laying out of gardens at\\nDholpur and at Ram Bagh and Zahra Bagh at Agra. Two mosques one at Agra and\\nthe other at Hissar belong to the reign of the second Mughal emperor Humayun. The\\ngrandness of Mughal architecture began with the construction of Humayun’s tomb\\nand its design by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas from Persia. He brought with him Persian\\ncraftsmen to work on the tomb. This tomb is the earliest specimen of a garden enclo-\\nsure and is raised on an arcaded sandstone platform. The tomb is octagonal and\\n14.6 Humayun’s Tomb\\n243\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\ncrowned by a high dome. The dome is a double dome, which is built in two layers one\\nwhich provides the ceiling to the interior of the building and the other, which provides\\nthe outer layer that crowns, the building.\\nDuring the reign of Akbar many indigenous styles were encouraged leading to the\\ncommon use of sandstone, the use of arches (mainly in a decorative form) and the\\ndecoration that comprised mainly of boldly carved or inlaid patterns complemented by\\nbrightly coloured patterns on the interiors. Among the important monumental projects\\nundertaken was the building of Agra fort, within the fort were many structures that\\nwere built in the Gujarat and Bengal styles, which were subsequently demolished by\\nShah Jahan who remodelled the fort and its interiors. The Janangir Mahal  conceived as\\na robust building in red sandstone, is a fusion of Hindu and Islamic building designs. The\\ncombination of beam and bracket form the principal structural system, the same styles\\nare seen in the palace fortresses of Lahore and Allahabad. Mughal architecture under\\nAkbar entered a new phase with the construction of Fatehpur Sikri. This city-palace\\nwas built entirely of red sandstone between 1571–1585. The buildings could be studied\\nunder two categories, religious and secular. Among the religious buildings are, the Jami\\nMasjid, the Buland Darwaza and the tombs of Shaikh Salim Chishti. The secular struc-\\ntures are the palaces, administrative buildings and other structures. The Jama Masjid\\nuses a typical plan of a mosque with a central courtyard, arcades on three sides and a\\ndomed skyline. In its courtyard lies the tomb of Salim Chishti. Among the palaces are\\nbuildings known as the Jodh Bai palace, the Panch Mahal (the size of this five storey\\nstructure that diminishes as one goes higher), the Diwan-i-Khas (is in the form of a\\nrectangle and is two stories from outside) and the Diwan-i- Am. Among the other\\nbuildings here are the Hathi Pol and the Karkhana buildings.\\nThe important buildings of the reigns of Jahangir include the Tomb of Akbar at Sikandara,\\nand the tomb of Itmad ud Daula. The tomb at Sikandara is designed as a tomb\\nFig. 14.7 Jama Masjid Delhi\\n244\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\n enclosure enclosed by a garden, the tomb itself is three stories high the first being an arcaded\\nplatform making the basement the middle portion is in three tiers of red sandstone while the\\nhighest one is made of white marble which is open on top with a screen surrounding it. The\\ntomb of Itmad ud Daula built in 1622–28 marks a change in architectural style from the\\nAkbari period. This enclosed tomb with a dome roof is enclosed with a beautiful marble\\ntracery. Jahangir is also known to have laid the famous Mughal gardens in Kashmir.\\nAmong the important monuments of the reign of Shah Jahan are the Lal Qila (in Delhi),\\nthe Moti Masjid (at Agra), the Jami Masjid in Delhi and the Taj Mahal. The Lal Qila is\\ndesigned as a rectangle along the banks of the river Yamuna. There are two gates, the\\nDelhi and Lahore gates. There is a moat that runs all along the fort except on the\\nriverside. The important buildings inside the fort are the Diwan-i-Am, Diwan-i-Khas\\nand the Rang Mahal. The Moti Masjid in Agra was an experiment with an alternative\\nscheme of an open prayer hall that had also dispensed with the minarets and replaced\\nthem with chhatris on the four coners of the prayer hall. The Jammi Masjid is a larger\\nversion of the Jammi Masjid in Fathepur Sikri. It is built on a large platform; within the\\nmosque there are colonnades on three sides with the sanctuary along the fourth. There\\nare three marble domes rising above the sanctuary. The Taj Mahal represents the grandest\\nproject of Shahjahan. The construction of the Taj began in 1632 and was completed by\\n1643. The plan of the complex is rectangle with a high enclosure wall and a lofty gate-\\nway in the middle. The main building of the Taj stands on a high marble platform at the\\nnorthern end of the enclosure. There is a huge dome that covers the top of this struc-\\nture, with an inverted lotus finial. The decorative features of the building consist mainly\\nof calligraphy and inlay work in the exterior and pietra dura in the interior.\\nThe Moti Masjid at Lal Qila in Delhi, the Badshahi Masjid in Lahore and the mausoleum built\\nfor his wife Rabia ud Dauran at Aurangabad are the main examples of Mughal architecture\\nunder Aurangzeb. The mausoleum at Aurangabad was modeled on the Taj Mahal. Of archi-\\ntectural monuments after Aurangzeb the tomb of Safdar Jang in Delhi is representative of\\nthe continuation of the tradition of the Mughals by the regional governors.\\nFig. 14.8 Safdarjung Tomb\\n245\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Cultural Developments in Medieval India\\nDecorative Styles\\nAnother feature of the art of this period was the decorative art in Islamic buildings\\nthat was introduced in the sub continent for the first time. These decorative styles\\nwere usually in the form of calligraphy, geometrical figures and foliation. In calligra-\\nphy quranic sayings were inscribed on buildings in an angular, sober and monumental\\nscript called kufi. The calligraphy was found on different parts of the buildings as on\\ndoorframes, ceilings, wall panels, etc. The geometric shapes on the other hand were\\nused in different variety of combinations. The generating source of these designs was\\nthe circle, which was then developed into a square, triangle or polygon. These forms\\nwere then elaborated by, multiplication and sub division, by rotating and by symmetri-\\ncal arrangements. Of the flotations, the dominant form of decoration employed in the\\nsultanate buildings was the arabesque. It was characterized by a continuous stem\\nthat split regularly, producing a series of leafy secondary stems which split again to\\nreintegrate into the main stem.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 10.6\\n1.\\nName two important changes in architectural forms made during the Medieval\\nperiod?\\n2.\\nWhat is a true arch?\\n3.\\nName a few monuments associated with early forms of Indo Islamic architec-\\nture?\\n4.\\nWhich type of stone was used in the construction of Fatehpur Sikri?\\n5.\\nName some of the decorative styles used in medieval architecture?\\nWHAT YOU HA\\nVE LEARNT\\nThe medieval Indian culture represents the synthesis of Indian and Persian philoso-\\nphy, literature art and architecture. In religious sphere Sufism and Bhakti tradition\\ninfluenced each other. They provided an opportunity for understanding religious tradi-\\ntions of Hindus and Muslims at people’s level.\\nThe emergence of Urdu as a new language is a best example of interaction and\\nsynthesis. The same is visible in the area of Music and Painting. In the field of archi-\\ntecture, the form, style and decoration take a lot from each other.\\nThe medieval period thus represents an important era of dramatic change in the\\nworld of religion and art in South Asia. The growing popularity of Sufism played an\\nimportant role in the popular acceptability of Islam and in the course establishing\\nunique Islamic tradition in the sub continent. The Bhakti movement played a similar\\nrole in the development of Hinduism. On one hand it challenged existing religious and\\n246\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nCultural Developments in Medieval India\\nsocial hierarchies and on the other it revived concepts like monotheism in mainstream\\nHindu tradition. Both the Sufi and Bhakti movements questioned the authority of the\\nestablished clergy and the relevance of established religious rituals. Importantly while\\nboth emerged questioning established religious traditions they eventually found them-\\nselves being integrated into established religious systems.\\nAnother important development during the medieval period was the growth in vernacular\\nliterature. Growing regional identities helped create new literary and art forms. The growth\\nin regional languages like Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi and Telugu was a very significant\\ndevelopment. The popularity of translations further widened readership and helped in the\\nexchange of ideas. The exchange of ideas also ushered new development in music. The\\nuse of the Sitar and new styles of music further enriched the medieval period.\\nIn the realm of art one witnesses the development of new styles of painting associ-\\nated with the patronage of the Mughal and the Rajput style There was a change in the\\ncharacter and stylistic representation seen in earlier periods. The synthesis of the\\nmedieval period is best seen in the development of new architectural styles. The large\\nnumber of forts, palaces, temples and Mosques that can be dated to this period are\\nexamples of the new styles.

The second was the transition in the polity, society and\\neconomy. In the 18th century English East India Company steered its way to position\\nof political dominance. The decline of the Mughal authority gave rise to the emer-\\ngence of a number of independent kingdoms. In this chapter we will study the emer-\\ngence of these independent kingdoms in different parts of the country. The aggres-\\nsive British policies affected the economic situation. The agricultural and non agricul-\\ntural production was altered. The commercial activities also underwent changes. These\\nwill also be discussed in the chapter. The social and cultural scenario of 18th century\\nwill also be analysed.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nexplain causes of the fall of the Mughal Empire and rise of the regional polities;\\n \\ngive an account of major political powers that emerged during this period;\\n \\ndistinguish the regional variations within the Indian economy of the period;\\n \\nidentify the features of society and culture in the 18th century and\\n \\nlist the issues involved in understanding the eighteenth century.\\n15.1 DECLINE OF THE MUGHAL EMPIRE\\nThe Background\\nThe unity and stability of the Mughal Empire was shaken during the long and strong\\nreign of Emperor Aurangzeb. However, in spite of setbacks and adverse circum-\\nstances the Mughal administration was still quite efficient and the Mughal army strong\\nat the time of his death in 1707. This year is generally considered to separate the era\\nof the great Mughals from that of the lesser Mughals. After the death of Aurangzeb\\nthe Mughal authority weakened, it was not in a position to militarily enforce its regu-\\nlations in all parts of the empire. As a result many provincial governors started to\\nassert their authority. In due course of time they gained independent status. At the\\nsame time many kingdoms which were subjugated by the Mughals also claimed their\\nindepence. Some new regional groups also consolidated and emerged as political\\n250\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Eighteenth Century India\\npower with all these developments, the period between 1707 and 1761 (third battle of Panipat,\\nwhere Ahmed Shah Abdali defeated the Maratha chiefs) witnessed resurgence of regional\\nidentity that buttressed both political and economic decentralization. At the same time,\\nintraregional as well as interregional trade in local raw materials, artifacts, and grains created\\nstrong ties of economic interdependence, irrespective of political and military relations.\\nPassing of the Mughal Empire\\nIn 1707, when Aurangzeb died, serious threats from the peripheries had begun to\\naccentuate the problems at the core of the empire. The new emperor, Bahadur Shah\\nI (or Shah Alam; ruled 1707–12), followed a policy of compromise, pardoning all\\nnobles who had supported his rivals. He granted them appropriate territories and\\npostings. He never abolished jizya, but the effort to collect the tax were not effec-\\ntive. In the beginning he tried to gain greater control over the Rajput states of the rajas\\nof Amber (later Jaipur) and Jodhpur. When his attempt met with firm resistance he\\nrealized the necessity of a settlement with them. However, the settlement did not\\nrestore them to fully committed warriors for the Mughal cause. The emperor’s policy\\ntoward the Marathas was also that of half-hearted conciliation. They continued to\\nfight among themselves as well as against the Mughals in the Deccan. Bahadur Shah\\nwas, however, successful in conciliating Chatrasal, the Bundela chief, and Churaman,\\nthe Jat chief; the latter also joined him in the campaign against the Sikhs.\\nJahandar Shah (ruled 1712–13) was a weak and ineffective ruler. His wazir Zulfiqar\\nKhan assumed the executive direction of the empire with unprecedented powers.\\nZulfiqar believed that it was necessary to establish friendly relations with the Rajputs\\nand the Marathas and to conciliate the Hindu chieftains in general in order to save the\\nempire. He reversed the policies of Aurangzeb. The hated jizya was abolished. He\\ncontinued the old policy of suppression against the Sikhs. His goal was to reconcile all\\nthose who were willing to share power within the Mughal institutional framework.\\nZulfiqar Khan made several attempts at reforming the economic system.\\nHe failed in his efforts to enhance the revenue collection of the state. When Farrukh\\nSiyar, son of the slain prince Azimush-Shan, challenged Jahandar Shah and Zulfiqar\\nKhan with a large army and funds from Bihar and Bengal, the rulers found their\\ncoffers depleted. In desperation, they looted their own palaces, even ripping gold and\\nsilver from the walls and ceilings, in order to finance an adequate army. Farrukh Siyar\\n(ruled 1713–19) owed his victory and accession to the Sayyid brothers, Abdullah\\nKhan and Husain Ali Khan Baraha. The Sayyids thus earned the offices of wazir and\\nchief bakhshi and acquired control over the affairs of state. They promoted the\\npolicies initiated earlier by Zulfiqar Khan. Jizya and other similar taxes were immedi-\\nately abolished. The brothers finally suppressed the Sikh revolt and tried to conciliate\\nthe Rajputs, the Marathas, and the Jats. However, this policy was hampered by divi-\\nsiveness between the wazir and the emperor, as the groups tended to ally themselves\\nwith one or the other. The Jats once again started plundering the royal highway be-\\ntween Agra and Delhi. Farrukh Siyar deputed Raja Jai Singh to lead a punitive cam-\\npaign against them but wazir negotiated a settlement over the raja’s head. As a result,\\nthroughout northern India zamindars either revolted violently or simply refused to\\npay assessed revenues. On the other hand, Farrukh Siyar compounded difficulties in\\nthe Deccan by sending letters to some Maratha chiefs urging them to oppose the\\nforces of the Deccan governor, who happened to be the deputy and an associate of\\nSayyid Husain Ali Khan. Finally, in 1719, the Sayyid brothers brought\\nAjit Singh of Jodhpur and a Maratha force to Delhi to depose the emperor.\\n251\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\nThe murder of Farrukh Siyar created a wave of revulsion against the Sayyids among\\nthe various factions of nobility, who were also jealous of their growing power. Many\\nof these, in particular the old nobles of Aurangzeb’s time, resented the wazir’s en-\\ncouragement of revenue farming, which in their view was mere shop keeping and\\nviolated the age- old Mughal notion of statecraft. In Farrukh Siyar’s place the broth-\\ners raised to the throne three young princes in quick succession within eight months in\\n1719. Two of these, Rafi- ud- Darajat and Rafi- ud- Dawlah (Shah Jahan II), died of\\nconsumption. The third, who assumed the title of Muhammad Shah, exhibited suffi-\\ncient vigour to set about freeing himself from the brothers’ control.\\nA powerful group under the leadership of the Nizam-ul-Mulk, Chin Qilich Khan, and\\nhis father’s cousin Muhammad Amin Khan, the two eminent nobles emerged finally to\\ndislodge the Sayyid brothers (1720). By the time Muhammad Shah (ruled 1719–48)\\ncame to power, the nature of the relationship between the emperor and the nobility had\\nalmost completely changed. Individual interests of the nobles had come to guide the\\ncourse of politics and state activities. In 1720 Muhammad Amin Khan replaced Sayyid\\nAbdullah Khan as wazir; after Amin Khan’s death (January 1720), the office was\\noccupied by the Nizam-ul-Mulk for a brief period until Amin Khan’s son Qamar-ud-Din\\nKhan assumed the title in July 1724 by a claim of hereditary right. The nobles them-\\nselves virtually dictated these appointments. By this time the nobles had assumed lot of\\npowers. They used to get farmans issued in the name of emperor in their favours. The\\nposition of emperor was preserved as a symbol only without real powers. The real\\npowers seated with important groups of nobles. The nobles in control of the central\\noffices maintained an all-empire outlook, even if they were more concerned with the\\nstability of the regions where they had their jagirs. Farmans (mandates granting cer-\\ntain rights or special privileges) to governors, faujdar, and other local officials were\\nsent, in conformity with tradition, in the name of the emperor. Individual failings of\\nAurangzeb’s successors also contributed to the decline of royal authority. Jahandar\\nShah lacked dignity and decency; Farrukh Siyar was fickle-minded; Muhammad Shah\\nwas frivulous and fond of ease and luxury. Opinions of the emperor’s favourites\\nweighed in the appointments, promotions, and dismissals even in the provinces.\\n15.2 THE RISE OF REGIONAL POLITIES AND STATES\\nThe states that arose in India during the phase of Mughal decline and the following\\ncentury (roughly 1700 to 1850) varied greatly in terms of resources, longevity, and\\nessential character. Some of them- such as Hyderabad in the south, was located in an\\narea that had harboured regional state in the immediate pre-Mughal period and thus\\nhad an older local or regional tradition of state formation. Others were states that had\\na more original character and derived from very specific processes that had taken\\nplace in the course of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In particular, many\\nof the post- Mughal states were based on ethnic or sectarian groupings- the Marathas,\\nthe Jats, and the Sikhs. In due course, the enrichment of the regions emboldened local\\nland and power-holders to take up arms against external authority. However, mutual\\nrivalry and conflicts prevented these rebels from consolidating their interests into an\\neffective challenge to the empire. They relied on support from kinsfolk, peasants, and\\nsmaller zamindars of their own castes. Each local group wanted to maximize its\\nshare of the prosperity at the expense of the others. The necessity of emphasizing\\nimperial symbols was inherent in the kind of power politics that emerged. Each of the\\ncontenders in the regions, in proportion to his strength, looked for and seized opportu-\\nnities to establish his dominance over the others in the neighbourhood. They all needed\\n252\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Eighteenth Century India\\na kind of legitimacy, which was so conveniently available in the long-accepted author-\\nity of the Mughal emperor. They had no fear in collectively accepting the symbolic\\nhegemony of the Mughal centre, which had come to co-exist with their ambitions.\\nThe gradual weakening of the central authority set in motion new types of provincial\\nkingdoms. Nobles with ability and strength sought to build a regional base for them-\\nselves. The wazir Chin Qilich Khan himself, showed the path. Having failed to re-\\nform the administration, he relinquished his office in 1723 and in October 1724 marched\\nsouth to establish the state of Hyderabad in the Deccan. The Mughal court’s chief\\nconcern at this stage was to ensure the flow of the necessary revenue from the\\nprovinces and the maintenance of at least the semblance of imperial unity. Seizing\\nupon the disintegration of the empire, the Marathas now began their northward ex-\\npansion and overran Malwa, Gujarat, and Bundelkhand. Then, in 1738–39, Nadir\\nShah, who had established himself as the ruler of Iran, invaded India.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 15.1\\n1.\\nWho succeeded Aurangzeb in 1707?

The most important Maratha warrior clan was of\\nthe Bhonsles, Sivaji Bhonsle, emerged as the most powerful figure in the southern politics.\\nThe good fortune of Sivaji did not fall to his sons and successors, Sambhaji, and his younger\\nbrother, Rajaran. For a time it appeared that Maratha power was on the decline. But a\\nrecovery was effected in the early eighteenth century, in somewhat changed circum-\\nstances. A particularly important phase in this respect is the reign of Sahu, who succeeded\\nRajaram in 1708. Sahu’s reign, lasted for four decades upto 1749. It was marked by the\\nascendancy of a lineage of Chitpavan Brahman ministers, who virtually came to control\\ncentral authority in the Maratha state. The Bhonsles were reduced to figureheads. Hold-\\ning the title of peshwa (chief minister), the first truly prominent figure of this line is Balaji\\nVisvanath, who had helped Sahu in his rise to power. Visvanath and his successor, Baji\\nRao I (peshwa between 1720 and 1740), managed to bureaucratise the Maratha state to\\na far greater extent than had been the case under the early Bhonsles. They systematized\\nthe practice of tribute gathering from Mughal territories, under the heads of sardeshmukhi\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\n253\\nand chauth (the two terms corresponding to the proportion of tribute collected). They\\nseem to have consolidated methods of assessment and collection of land revenue and\\nother taxes, on the lines of the Mughals. Much of the revenue terminology used in the\\ndocuments of the peshwa and his subordinates derives from Persian. This suggests a\\ngreater continuity between Mughal and Maratha revenue practices.\\nThe Maratha Confederacy\\nBy the close of Sahu’s reign, a few powerful Maratha Kingdoms were in complete\\ncontrol of their territories. This period saw the development of sophisticated networks\\nof trade, banking, and finance in the territories under their control. The banking houses\\nbased at Pune, had their branches in Gujarat, Ganges Valley, and the south. Attention\\nwas also paid to the Maritime affairs. Bala ji Visvanath took some care to cultivate\\nthe Angria clan, which controlled a fleet of vessels based in Kolaba and other centres\\nof the west coast. These ships posed a threat not only to the new English settlement\\nMap 15.1 The Maratha Confederacy\\n254\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Eighteenth Century India\\nof Bombay, but to the Portuguese at Goa, Bassein, and Daman. On the other hand,\\nthere also emerged a far larger domain of activity away from the original heartland of\\nthe Marathas. Of these chiefs, the most important were the Gaikwads (Gaekwars),\\nthe Sindhias, and the Holkars. Also, there were branches of the Bhonsle family that\\nrelocated to Kolhapur and Nagpur, while the main line remained in the Deccan heart-\\nland, at Satara. Let us examine their areas of influence.\\nThe Bhonsles of Nagpur\\nUnlike the Kolhapur Bhonsles and the descendants of Vyamkoji at Thanjavur, both of\\nwhom claimed a status equal to that of the Satara raja, the line at Nagpur was clearly\\nsubordinate to the Satara rulers. A crucial figure from this line is Raghuji Bhonsle (ruled\\n1727–55), who was responsible for the Maratha incursions on Bengal and Bihar in the\\n1740s and early 1750s. The relations of his successors, Janoji, Sabaji, and Mudhoji, with\\nthe peshwas and the Satara line were varying, and it is in this sense that these domains\\ncan be regarded as only loosely confederated, rather than tightly bound together. Other\\nsubordinate rulers who emerged under the overarching umbrella provided by the Satara\\nruler and his peshwa were equally somewhat opportunistic in their use of politics.\\nThe Gaikwads of Baroda\\nThe Gaikwads, gathered prominence in the 1720. Initially they were subordinate not\\nonly to the Bhonsles but also to the powerful Dabhade family. However, it was only\\nafter the death of Sahu, when the power of the peshwas was further enhanced, that\\nthe position of the Gaikwads truly improved. By the early 1750s, their rights on large\\nportion of the revenues of Gujarat were recognized by the peshwa. The expulsion of the\\nMughal governor of the Gujarat province from his capital of Ahmadabad in 1752 set the\\nseal on the process. The Gaikwads preferred, however, to establish their capital in\\nBaroda, causing realignment in the network of trade and consumption in the area. The\\nrule at Baroda of Damaji (d. 1768) was followed by a period of some turmoil. The\\nGaikwads still remained partly dependent on Pune and the peshwa, especially to inter-\\nvene in moments of succession crisis. The eventual successor of Damaji, Fateh Singh\\n(ruled 1771– 89), did not remain allied to the peshwa for long in the late 1770s and early\\n1780s, he chose to negotiate a settlement with the English East India Company, which\\neventually led to increased British interference in his affairs. By 1800, the British rather\\nthan the peshwa were the final arbiters in determining succession among the Gaikwads,\\nwho became subordinate rulers under them in the nineteenth century.\\nThe Holkars of lndore\\nIn the case of the Holkars the rise in status and wealth was particularly rapid and\\nmarked. Initially they had very little political power. However by 1730s their chief\\nMalhar Rao Holkar consolidated his position. He was granted a large share of the\\nchauth collection in Malwa, eastern Gujarat, and Khandesh. Within a few years,\\nMalhar Rao consolidated his own principality at Indore, from which his successors\\ncontrolled important trade routes as well as the crucial trading centre of Burhanpur.\\nAfter him, control of the dynastic fortunes fell largely to his son’s widow, Ahalya Bai,\\nwho ruled from 1765 to 1794 and brought Holkar power to great glory. Nevertheless,\\ntheir success could not equal that of the next great chieftain family, the Sindhias.\\nThe Sindhias of Gwalior\\nThe Sindhias carved a prominent place for themselves in North Indian politics in the\\ndecades following the third battle of Panipat (1761). Again, like the Holkars, the Sindhias\\nwere based largely in central India, first at Ujjain, and later (from the last quarter of\\n255\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\nthe . 18th century) in Gwalior. During the long reign of Mahadaji Sindhia (1761–94)\\nfamily’s fortunes were truly consolidated.\\nMahadaji, proved an effective and innovative military commander. He employed a\\nlarge number of European soldiers in his force. His power grew rapidly after 1770. During\\nthis period he managed to make substantial inroads into North India that had been weak-\\nened by Afghan attacks. He intervened with some effect in the Mughal court during the\\nreign of Shah Alam II. The Mughal king made him the “deputy regent” of his affairs in the\\nmid-1780s. His shadow fell not only across the provinces of Delhi and Agra but also on\\nRajasthan and Gujarat, making him the most formidable Maratha leader of the era. The\\nofficials of the East India Company were very cautious in dealing with him.\\nHis relations with the acting peshwa, Nana Fadnavis at Pune were fraught with tension.\\nEventually, the momentum generated by Mahadaji could not be maintained by his suc-\\ncessor Daulat Rao Sindhia (ruled 1794–1827), who was defeated by the British and\\nforced by treaty in 1803 to surrender his territories both to the north and to the west.\\nThe careers of some of these potentates, especially Mahadaji Sindhia, illustrate the po-\\ntency of Mughal symbols even in the phase of Mughal decline. For instance, after recap-\\nturing Gwalior from the British, Mahadaji took care to have his control of the town sanc-\\ntioned by the Mughal emperor. Equally, he zealously guarded the privileges and titles\\ngranted to him by Shah Alam, such as amir al-umara (“head of the amirs”) and na’ib\\nwakii-i mutlaq (“deputy regent”). In this he was not alone. Instances in the 18th century\\nof states that wholly threw off all pretense of allegiance to the Mughals are rare. Rather,\\nthe Mughal system of honours and titles, as well as Mughal- derived administrative termi-\\nnology and fiscal practices, continued despite the decline of imperial power.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 15.2\\n1.\\nName the single most important power that emerged during the declining phase\\nof Mughal dynasty.\\n2.\\nWho was referred as Peshwa during the Maratha rule?

However, he\\nregularly sent tribute to the Mughal emperor. Ali Vardi Khan deposed the family of Murshid\\nQuli Khan and made himself the Nawab in 1739. These Nawabs brought stability and\\npeace and promoted agriculture, trade and industry. Equal opportunities were given to\\nboth Hindus and Muslims. But the Nawabs could not visualise the long term implications\\nof the presence of the European trading companies and neglected military preparedness.\\nIn 1756–1757, the successor of Ali Vardi Khan, Siraj- ud - Daulah had to fight the English\\nEast India Company over the trading rights. His defeat in the battle of Plassey in June\\n1757 paved the way for subjugation of Bengal as well as India.\\n15.5 THE NAWABS OF AWADH\\nWith the weakening central control the Mughal suba of Awadh also saw emerging\\nambitions of a provincial governor- Saadat Khan Burhan ul Mulk. Saadat Khan disci-\\nplined the local zamindars and gave shape to a well paid, well armed and well trained\\narmy. Before his death in 1739, Saadat Khan made the provincial head a hereditary\\nposition. His successors Safdar Jung and Asaf ud Daulah not only played very decisive\\nrole in the politics of northern India but also gave a long term administrative stability to\\nthe nawabi of Awadh. Under the Nawabs firstly Faizabad and then Lucknow became\\nthe cultural rival of Delhi in the spheres of arts, literature and crafts. Regional architec-\\nture reflected itself in the form of Imambarah and other buildings. The evolution of\\ndance form Kathak was the outcome of cultural synthesis.\\n15.6 THE SIKHS OF PUNJAB\\nThe Mughal force supressed the Sikhs under Banda Bahadur. But this did not put an\\nend to Sikh resistance to Mughal authority. In the 1720s and 1730s, Amritsar emerged\\nas a centre of Sikh activity, mainly because of its preeminence as a pilgrimage cen-\\ntre. Kapur Singh, the most important of the Sikh leaders of the time, operated from its\\nvicinity. He gradually set about consolidating a revenue-cum military system. Some\\nSikh groups also started consolidating themselves as political force. These activities\\ndiscouraged the attempts by the Mughal governors of Lahore Suba to set up an\\nindependent power base for themselves in the region. First Abdus Samad Khan and\\nthen his son Zakariya Khan attempted to control sovereign power. After the latter’s\\ndemise in 1745, the balance shifted still further in favour of the Sikh warrior- leaders,\\nsuch as Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. He later on founded the kingdom of Kapurthala. The\\nmushrooming of pockets under the authority of Sikh leaders was thus a feature of the\\ntwo decades preceding Ahmed Shah Abdali’s invasion of the Punjab. This process\\nwas evident in the eastern Punjab and Bari Doab. Though the principal opposition\\nfaced by Abdali in his campaigns of the 1750s and 1760s in the Punjab came from the\\nSikhs, Marathas also played a role of significance on this occasion. Eventually, by the\\nmid- 1760s, Sikh authority over Lahore was established, and the Afghans were not\\nable to consolidate their early gains. Under Ahmad Shah’s successor, Timur Shah\\n(ruled 1772–93), some of the territories and towns that had been taken by the Sikhs\\n(such as Multan) were recovered, and the descendants of Ahmad Shah continued to\\nharbour ambitions in this direction until the end of the century. But by the 1770s, they\\nwere dealing with a confederation of about 60 Sikh chieftains, some of these were to\\nemerge as princely states under the British- such as Nabha and Patiala.\\n257\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\nThe Sikh chiefdoms continued many of the administrative practices initiated by the\\nMughals. The main subordinates of the chiefs were given jagir assignments. The\\nPersianized culture of the Mughal bureaucracy continued to hold sway. It was one such\\nchief, Ranjit Singh, grandson of Charhat Singh Sukerchakia, who eventually welded\\nthese principalities for a brief time into a larger entity. Ranjit Singh’s effective rule lasted\\nfour decades, from 1799 to 1839. The power of the English East India Company was\\ngrowing in all parts of the country during this period. Within ten years of his death, the\\nBritish had annexed Punjab. His rise to power was based on superior military force,\\npartly serviced by European mercenaries and by the strategic location of the territories\\nthat he had inherited from his father. Ranjit Singh’s kingdom represented the culmina-\\ntion of nearly a century of Sikh rebellions against Mughal rule. It was based on the\\nintelligent application of principles of statecraft. He used as his capital the great trading\\ncity of Lahore, which he captured in 1799. Having gained control of the trade routes, he\\nimposed monopolies on the trade in salt, grain, and textiles from Kashmir to enhance his\\nrevenues. Using these earnings, he built up an army of 40,000 cavalry and infantry. By\\nthe year 1809 he was undisputed master of the most of Punjab.\\n15.7 JAIPUR AND OTHER RAJPUTANA STATES\\nJaipur (earlier Amber) in eastern Rajasthan, was a Rajput principality controlled by\\nthe Kachwaha clan. In the early eighteenth century, the ruler Jai Singh Sawai took steps\\nto increase his power manyfold. This was done by: (i) arranging to have his jagir assign-\\nment in the vicinity of his home territories and (ii) by taking on rights on land revenue\\nthrough farming (for collection of land tax rights on a parcel of land that are rented by the\\nstate to an individual), which was gradually made permanent. By the time of his death in\\n1743, Jai Singh (after whom Jaipur came to be named) had emerged as the single most\\nimportant ruler in the region. Most of the larger Rajput states were constantly involved in\\npetty quarrels and civil wars. Ajit Singh of Marwar was killed by his own son.\\nIn the 1750s Suraj Mal the Jat ruler of Bharatpur, like Jai Singh- adopted a modified form\\nof Mughal revenue administration in his territories. However, by this time, the fortunes of\\nthe Jaipur kingdom were seriously in question. Under threat from the Marathas, recourse\\nhad to be taken to adopt short- term fiscal exactions. At the same time a series of crop\\nfailures in the 1750s and 60s adversely affected fragile agriculture. The second half of the\\neighteenth century was thus marked by an economic depression, accompanied by a de-\\ncline in the political power of Jaipur. During this period Jaipur became a vulnerable target\\nfor the ambitions of the Marathas, and of Mahadaji Sindhia in particular.\\nThe states discussed so far, with the exception of Maratha, were all landlocked. This\\ndid not mean that trade was not an important element in their makeup, for the king-\\ndom of Ranjit Singh was crucially linked to trade. However, lack of access to the sea\\ngreatly increased the vulnerability of a state, particularly in an era when the major\\npower was the English East India Company, itself initially a maritime enterprise.\\n15.8 POLITICS IN SOUTH INDIA\\nIn the south, unlike the areas discussed so far, several states did make a determined\\nbid in this period to consolidate their power by the use of access to sea and ports.\\nPrincipal among these were Travancore in Kerala under Martanda Varma and Rama\\nVarma, and Mysore under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan.\\nThese states rose to prominence only in the latter half of the eighteenth century, or at\\nleast after 1740. Before that, the southern Indian scene had been dominated by a\\ngroup of Muslim notables who had accompanied the Mughal expansion into the\\n258\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Eighteenth Century India\\nregion in the 1680s and 1690s, or else had come in a second wave that followed immedi-\\nately after 1700. Many of these notables set themselves up as tribute-paying chiefs under\\nMughal authority. Some of them were relatively petty nawabs (deputies) of the Balaghat,\\nor northern Karnataka (such as Abdul Rasul Khan of Sira). A few of them were political\\nheavy weights like the Nizam-ul-Mulk himself and Sadullah Khan at Arcot. The Nizam-ul-\\nMulk had consolidated his position in Hyderabad by the 1740s, whereas the Arcot princi-\\npality had emerged some three decades earlier. Neither of these rulers, while establishing\\ndynastic succession, claimed full sovereignty. Thus they continued to cast themselves as\\nrepresentatives of Mughal authority. Southern Indian politics in the 1720s emerged, there-\\nfore, as a game with many petty players and three formidable ones: the Marathas (both at\\nThanjavur and elsewhere), the Nizam, and the Arcot (or Karnatak) Nawab.\\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century, the power of all three of these centres\\ndeclined. The succession struggle at Arcot in the 1740s and early 1750s left its rulers\\nopen to financial manipulation by private British merchants, to whom they were in-\\ncreasingly in debt for war expenses. In the 1750s the power of Hyderabad also de-\\nclined (after the death of its founder, the Nizam-ul-Mulk). The control of the coastal\\ndistricts was soon lost, leaving the kingdom landlocked and relatively sparsely popu-\\nlated. In this context, the only option for states was to build an elaborate and well-\\norganized war machine while keeping external supply lines open. The control of trade\\nwas also seen as crucial in the statecraft of the period.\\nThe State of Travancore\\nThese principles were put into practice in the southern Kerala state of Venad\\n(Travancore) by Martanda Varma (ruled 1729–58). The king initiated a few mea-\\nsures to strengthen his authority. These were (i) he built a substantial standing army\\nof about 50,000 (ii) reduced the power of the Nayar aristocracy on which rulers of the\\narea had earlier been dependent militarily, and (iii) fortified the northern limits of his\\nkingdom at the so-called “Travancore line.” It was also the policy of this ruler to\\nextend patronage to the Syrian Christians, a large trading community within his do-\\nmains, as a means of limiting European involvement in trade. The key commodity was\\npepper, but other goods also came to be defined as royal monopoly items, requiring a\\nlicense for trade. These policies were continued in large measure by Martanda’s\\nsuccessor, Rama Varma (ruled 1758–98), who was able to defend his kingdom suc-\\ncessfully against a dangerous new rival power- Mysore.\\nThe Rise of Mysore\\nUnder rulers of the Vadiyar dynasty, such as Kanthirava Narasaraja and Chikka\\nDeva Raja Mysore emerged as an important state. However, Mysore was a land-\\nlocked kingdom and dependent therefore on trade and military supplies brought through\\nthe ports of the Indian east coast. As these ports came increasingly under European\\ncontrol, Mysore’s vulnerability increased. From the 1760s, steps were taken to change\\nthis situation. A cavalry commander of migrant origin, Haidar Ali, assumed effective\\npower in the kingdom in 1761, reducing the Vadiyars to figureheads and displacing the\\npowerful Kalale family of ministers. First Haidar and then, after 1782, his son, Tipu\\nSultan, made attempts to consolidate Mysore and make it a kingdom with access to\\nnot one but both coasts of peninsular India. Against the Kodavas, the inhabitants of\\nthe upland kingdom of Kodagu (Coorg), they were relatively successful. Coastal\\nKarnataka and northern Kerala came under their sway, enabling Tipu to open diplo-\\nmatic and commercial relations on his own account with the Middle East. Tipu’s\\nambitions apparently greatly exceeded those of his father, and he strove actively to\\n259\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\nescape the all- pervasive shadow of Mughal suzerainty, as discussed above. How-\\never, the problem with the Mysore of Haidar and Tipu was their inability to build an\\ninternal consensus. Their dependence on migrants and mercenaries, for both military\\nand fiscal expertise, was considerable, and they were always resisted by local chiefs,\\nthe so called Poligars. More crucial was the fact that by the 1770s Mysore faced a\\nformidable military adversary in the form of the English East India Company, which\\ndid not allow it any breathing room. It was the English who denied Mysore access to\\nthe relatively rich agricultural lands and ports of the Coromandel coastal plain in east-\\nern India. Tipu was also finally killed in 1799 by the English forces.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 15.3\\n1.\\nIn which region and under whose patronage did the dance form- kathak evolve?\\n2.\\nWhy was the battle of Plassey, 1757 significant?\\n3.\\nName the sultan of Mysore who faced the challenge of the British East India\\ncompany.

It was a period of considerable political\\nturmoil in India, one in which states were formed and dissolved in quick succession.\\nThat there was a great deal of fluidity in the system. It is of course true that raids by\\nmilitary forces would have caused dislocation. The destruction of irrigation tanks, the\\nforcible expropriation of cattle wealth, and even the forced march of masses of people\\nwere not unknown in the wars of the 1770s and thereafter. All these must have had a\\nharmful effect on economic stability and curtailed the impulse toward growth.\\nWhen viewed from Delhi, the 18th century is certainly a gloomy period. The attacks\\nof Nadir Shah, then of Ahmad Shah Abdali, and finally the attacks by the Rohillas\\n(who controlled Delhi in 1761–71) put the city in a state of regular destruction. This\\nperspective can hardly have been shared by the inhabitants of other centres in India,\\nwhether Trivandrum, Pune, Patna, or Jaipur. There was a process of economic reori-\\nentation that accompanied the political decentralization of the era, and it is on account\\nof this that the experience of Delhi and Agra cannot be generalized. However, the\\nconditions of different regions were not uniform. In some, the first half of the eigh-\\nteenth century witnessed continued expansion- Bengal, Jaipur, and Hyderabad, for\\nexample. While some others were late bloomers, as in the case of Travancore, Mysore,\\nor the Punjab. No single chronology of economic prosperity and decline is likely there-\\nfore to fit all the regions of India in the epoch. Despite some key weaknesses and\\ncontradictions the economy of the eighteenth century performed well in the spheres\\nof agriculture, inland trade and urbanization. There were some areas which saw ag-\\nricultural decline- often because of inter state warfare as in the Punjab and parts of\\nnorth India. Lack of new agricultural methods and techniques was overcome with the\\nexperience and management of land and labour. Data of Taqsim papers used and\\ncompared vis a vis Ain-i-Akbari proves that it was not the lack of cultivable land but\\n260\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Eighteenth Century India\\nlack of labour and peace which resulted into declining agricultural production and\\nfluctuating agricultural prices as well. At the same time the price rise benefited the\\npeasants but unequally according to vertically divided sections of peasantry. States\\nexacted tribute from systems of agricultural commodity production that tied villages\\nto expansive networks of commercial mobility and exchange.\\nIt is noteworthy that, except for a major subsistence crisis in south India between\\n1702 and 1704, the first seven decades of eighteenth century in India were remark-\\nably free of famine. The great Bengal famine of 1770, in which an estimated one- third of the\\npopulation perished, occurred soon after the colonial conquest. This was followed by another\\ndisastrous famine in north India in 1783. Overall a favourable land- labour ratio had enabled\\nhighly mobile peasant and tribal labour to negotiate reasonable terms with controllers of land.\\nBut the excessive revenue demands made the peasants’ desertion a regular phenomenon\\nparticularly in north India. While some village notables managed to transform revenue farms\\ninto hereditary estates, others felt the squeeze from powerful regional states as Tipu’s Mysore.\\nPopulation, production, prices and wages tended, generally speaking, to be on a gentle up-\\nward incline during the eighteenth century. Fragmented polities did not hamper the develop-\\nment of a thriving inland trade in grain, cloth and cattle. Corporate merchant institutions\\ntranscended political boundaries in overseeing the transportation of goods and the provision\\nof credit and insurance services. Pre- colonial era artisnal labour, especially weavers, had\\nample scope for successfully resisting extravagant demands by intermediate social groups\\nand the state. Even an intrusive state like late- eighteenth century Mysore appeared to attack\\nintermediaries rather than labour. Evidence from Bengal and Madras suggests that urban\\nlabour was worse off in relation to the state and the market in the early colonial than in the\\nimmediate precolonial period. While inland trade did well, the Indian shippers and merchants\\ninvolved in export trade declined in the face of European advances. The great Gujarati port\\ncity of Surat lost its importance around 1720. There was a resurgence of demand for Indian\\ngoods in both West and South East \\nAsia in the late eighteenth century in addition to European\\ndemand, but by now British merchants and shippers had achieved dominance at the expense\\nof Indians and took the bulk of the profits.\\nAs the old commercial centres of Surat, Masulipatnam and Dhaka degenerated, colonial\\nport- cities like Bombay, Madras and Calcutta took their pride of place. But the decline of the\\nMughal capitals of Delhi and Agra was offset by the rise of regional capitals, including\\nLucknow, Hyderabad, the various Maratha cities, and Seringapatam. The level of urbaniza-\\ntion was clearly higher in 1800 than a century before. What had changed in the urban centres\\nwas the relative balance of power between rulers and merchants. In some instances, com-\\nmercial and financial magnets were arrogating to themselves the powers of the state.\\nIt would also appear for a variety of reasons, that the mid- eighteenth century marks\\na significant change in economic sphere. For example, once the English East India\\nCompany got hold on the revenues of Bengal subah the flow of money was ad-\\nversely affected. While earlier Bengal received gold and silver in exchange for its\\nexports, this pattern no longer held. In later part of eighteenth century the peasants\\nwere forced to cultivate certain cash crops like indigo and opium. This had adverse\\nimpact on food crop production. But another reason why the latter half of the eigh-\\nteenth century differs from the period before about 1750 is the changing character of\\nwar. In the post-1750 period, warfare became more disruptive of civil life and eco-\\nnomic production than before, and at the same time the new technologies in use made it\\na far more expensive proposition. The use of firearms on a large scale, the employment\\nof mercenaries, the maintenance of standing armies, all of these had harmful affects.\\n261\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\n15.10 THE SOCIAL CONTEXT\\nThe social life in eighteenth century India was continuation of the past legacy. De-\\nspite some universal features of socio- cultural unity through out India over the centu-\\nries, there was no uniformity in the social patterns. The society was divided into multi\\nlayered identities on the basis of religion, region, tribe, language, class and caste.\\nHindus were divided on the basis of hundreds of castes. The caste was decided by\\nbirth, fixing the permanent place of the people in social hierarchy. Inter- caste mar-\\nriages and inter caste- dining was forbidden. Traditionally, caste was the basis of the\\nprofession but by the eighteenth century to some extent social and professional mobil-\\nity was being followed. For example Brahmans started adopting various progenies\\nand pursuing trading activities. The caste continued to be a major divisive force.\\nMuslims were also influenced by the considerations of race, caste, tribe and status. The\\nShias and Sunnis had major religious differences while the Irani, Afghani, Turani and\\nHindustani Muslims had lot of differences to stand apart from each other. People con-\\nverted to Islam carried their caste into the religion. The basic social unit was the family\\nbased on patriarchal patterns except Kerela where matrilineal system was prevalent.\\nWomen’s were expected to live as the role models of ideal daughters, wives and moth-\\ners. Women of the upper classes, in north India, had to follow purdah. Child marriages\\nwas prevalent and marriage was a social obligation between the two families. Among\\nthe upper classes polygamy and dowry was prevalent but the greatest evil of eighteenth\\ncentury India were the custom of sati and the condition of widows among the Hindus.\\nThe education system could not change according to the requirements of the time.\\nThe curriculum was confined to literature, languages, law, religion, philosophy and\\nlogic and excluded the study of physical and natural sciences, technology and geogra-\\nphy. There was lack of progressive ideas as theoretical framework dominated. El-\\nementary education was widespread. Mediums of higher education were Sanskrit\\nand Persian only. Moreover, this education excluded females and low caste people.\\n15.11 THE CULTURAL MILIEU\\nIt is generally maintained that the eighteenth century witnessed a general decline in\\nmaterial life, the cultural life of the period also has often been denigrated. However,\\nthere appears to be little justification for such a portrayal of the 18th century. Even\\nDelhi, whose economic condition unequivocally declined, had a number of major po-\\nets, philosophers, and thinkers in this epoch, from Shah Waliullah to Mir Taqi Mir.\\nFurther, as regional courts grew in importance, they tended to take on the function of\\nthe principal patrons of high culture, whether in music, the visual arts, or literature. It\\nis thus also in relatively dispersed centres, ranging from Awadh to Bikaner and Lahore\\nto Thanjavur, that one finds the courtly traditions of culture persisting. Thanjavur\\nunder the Marathas is a particularly fine example of cultural efflorescence, in which\\nliterary production of a high quality in Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, and Marathi continued,\\nwith some of the Maratha rulers themselves playing a significant direct role. Similarly,\\nit is in the eighteenth century Thanjavur that the main compositions of what is today\\nknown as the Karnatak tradition of Indian classical music came to be written, by such\\nmen as Tyagaraja, Muttuswami Diksitar, and Syama Sastri. Finally, the period brought\\nthe development of a distinct style of painting in Thanjavur, fusing elements imported\\nfrom the north with older local traditions of textile painting.\\nThis vitality was not restricted purely to elite culture. To begin with, many of the\\ntheatre and musical traditions, as well as formal literary genres of the period, picked\\n262\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\n \\nUnderstanding Eighteenth Century India\\nup and ‘reincorporated folk influences. At the same time, the interaction of popular\\nHinduism and Islam gave a particular flavour to cultural activities associated with\\npilgrimages and festivals. More than in earlier centuries, the tradition of long-distance\\npilgrimages to major centres from Varanasi to Rameswaram increased and scan be\\nseen to fit in with a general trend of increasing mobility. It was common for post-\\nMughal states to employ mercenary soldiers and imported scribes and clerks. In eigh-\\nteenth century Hyderabad, for example, Kayasthas from the north were employed in\\nlarge numbers in the bureaucracy. ln Mysore, Maharashtrian Brahmans were given\\nfiscal offices as early as the 1720s. It is apparent that the mobility of musicians, men\\nof letters, and artists was widely prevalent. When a major new political centre emerged,\\nit rapidly attracted talent, as evidenced in Ranjit Singh’s Lahore. Here, Persian\\nliterature of high quality was produced, but not at the cost of literary output in Punjabi.\\nAt the same time, new developments were visible in the fields of architecture and\\npainting. Farther to the north, the principality of Kangra fostered an important new\\nschool of painting, devoted largely to Vaishnava themes. The cultural assimilation was\\noutcome of mutual influence and respect. Among the major religions the Marathas\\nsupported the shrine of Shaikh Muinuddin Chisti in Ajmer and the Raja of Tanjore\\nfinanced the shrine of Shaikh Shahul Hamid of Nagaur. Tipu Sultan of Mysore\\nsupported Shringeri temple and Muslims joyfully participated in the Hindu festivals\\njust as the Hindus were part of Muharram processions. Indeed, a surprisingly large\\nproportion of what is understood today to be part of India’s ‘traditional” culture is\\nattributable to this period and also to the preceding century.\\n15.12 DEBATE AND PROBLEMS IN UNDERSTANDING THE\\nHISTORY OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\\nThe debate on the nature of eighteenth century has engaged historians of Mughal\\nIndia as well those interested in colonial studies. Early Mughal studies view the over\\nall changes in the shadow of Mughal political collapse and project the period as “Dark\\nAges”, thus Mughal political crisis is seen to be accompanied by economic and social\\nbreakdown as well. However, later studies scrutinize eighteenth century economy\\nand society in regional perspectives preceding the beginning of the colonial rule that\\ncharacterized the second half of the eighteenth century. Thus the two positions argue\\naround “continuity versus change” paradigm. Generally, Indian historians perceive the\\ncolonial conquest which began from the mid eighteenth century as a point of departure\\nfor Indian history. So the basic issues pertaining to eighteenth century are two- whether\\nthe fall of Mughal Empire initiated the fall of socio- economic structure as well and\\nsecondly, whether the arrival of colonialism was a fundamental break or not?\\nWas the eighteenth century a Dark Age or was it a period of economic boom? Did it\\nmark a sharp break or was it a period of continuity and change? How British power\\nin India expanded during the eighteenth century? These and other questions concern-\\ning the nature of politics, society, economy, religion and culture made the study of\\nhistory of eighteenth century highly debatable. Historians have traditionally viewed\\nIndia’s eighteenth century as a dark era of warfare, political chaos, and economic\\ndecline sandwiched between stable and prosperous Mughal and British hegemonies.\\nThis view has been vigorously challenged by the most recent generation of Indian\\nhistorians, who have emphasized the continuities between the earlier Mughal and\\nlater British states and the constellation of small successor states that emerged with\\nthe ebbing of Mughal power. The political turmoil which affected the whole century,\\nforces one to ask whether the fall of the Mughal empire led to a break of the central\\n263\\nMODULE - 2\\nMedieval India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Understanding Eighteenth Century India\\npolitical authority triggering the phase of anarchy, firstly leading to the rise of regional\\nkingdoms then paving the way for dominance of British colonialism. Here it is important\\nto understand whether just the decline of the Mughal state should be seen as a failure of\\nIndian society as well as the vacuum created by the fall of the central authority filled up\\nby the regional powers namely, Nawabs of Awadh and Bengal and Nizam of Hyderabad\\nin the first half of the century.

The British East India Company\\nsometimes referred to as “John Company”, was a Joint- Stock Company established\\nin 1600, as The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies.\\nDuring this time, other trading companies, established by the Portuguese, Dutch,\\nFrench, and Danish were similarly expanding in the region. The British Company\\ngained footing in India in 1612 after Mughal emperor Jahangir granted the rights to\\nestablish a factory (a trading post) in Surat to Sir Thomas Roe, a representative\\ndiplomat of Queen Elizabeth Ist  of England. The formal British rule in India is under-\\nstood to have commenced in 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of\\nBengal surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company. Henceforth the\\nBritish Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to a political entity\\nwhich virtually ruled India. Now it acquired auxiliary governmental and military func-\\ntions, until its dissolution in 1858 when, consequent to the Government of India\\nAct 1858, the British government assumed the task of directly administering India.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nlearn the European commercial and political stakes in India.\\n \\nthe reasons for the conflicts between the English and the French in India in the\\n18th Century.\\n \\nknow the growth of British power in Bengal.\\n \\nunderstand the expansion of British Power in India.\\n \\ngain knowledge about the Subsidiary Alliances concluded by Lord Wellesley.\\n \\nknow how the Policy of Doctrine of Lapse, introduced by Lord Dalhousie, led to\\nthe expansion of British power in India.\\n16.1 A NEW PHASE IN EUROPEAN EASTERN TRADE WITH ASIA\\nEven after securing the control over the trade routes during sixteenth-seventeenth\\ncenturies, the Europeans did not solve the basic pattern which had long dominated\\ntrade between India and the West. Indian goods were in far greater demand in\\n2\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857\\nEurope than were European goods in India. Merchants might profit handsomely through\\nthe sale of Indian goods, which were of both better quality and lesser price than\\nsimilar European products. The result was both a drain of bullion from Europe to\\nIndia, as well as stiff competition for European producers who were unable to match\\neither the price or quality of Indian goods.\\nIn fact the British East India Company, in the first 50 years of its existence, had no\\ninterest in the development of colonies, preferring to engage in trade only, following\\nthe pattern set by the Portuguese. This pattern was changed by 1650 when the power\\nof the old guard British royalist merchants was broken, and a new class of merchants\\nwrested control of the Company. They followed the pattern set by the colonial mer-\\nchants in American colonies and the West Indies, and sought to establish a network of\\ncolonies linking England, Africa and India in a complicated network of exchange\\nrelationships.\\nThe Mughal Empire declined in the first half of the eighteenth century. The political\\nvacuum was filled by the rise of regional states like Bengal, Hyderabad, Awadh,\\nPunjab and Maratha Kingdoms. But these regional powers could not provide lasting\\npolitical stability resulting into a lustful chance for the British East India Company to\\nestablish a territorial empire in India. Now a set of institutions and regulations were\\nrequired to rule India through colonial mechanism. They adopted three methods to\\nexpand the British Empire. They were: 1. Wars and conquests, 2. Subsidiary\\nAlliance System, and 3. annexation of territories through the adaptation of\\ndoctrine of lapse. Initial method was outright military conquest or direct annexation\\nof territories; it was these areas that were properly called British India.

The Anglo- French rivalry, taking the form of three Carnatic Wars\\nconstituted landmarks in the history of British conquest of south India in the\\neighteenth century. In order to establish their supremacy, it was necessary for\\nthe English East India Company to eliminate the French from this region. As a\\nresult of Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) in Europe, the French and English settle-\\nments in India also became involved in open hostilities. In the third Carnatic war,\\nthe British East India Company defeated the French forces at the battle of\\nWandiwash ending almost a century of conflict over supremacy in India. This\\n3\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n ESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857\\nbattle gave the British trading company a far superior position in India compared\\nto the other Europeans. The French were defeated by Sir Eyre Coote at\\nWandiwash in January, 1760, and Pondicherry capitulated a year later. The work\\nof Dupleix and Bussy in the South was thus destroyed in 1760–1761; the French\\npossessions in India were, however, restored by the treaty of Paris (1763). This\\nconflict was resolved in the English East India Company’s favour because of its\\nstrong navy in India, its progressively increasing military strength and good lead-\\nership, the support they received from the Government in England, and the larger\\nresources at its command in Bengal. A part of the fallout of the events in the\\nCarnatic cycle of wars that the weakness of the Indian regional powers (in par-\\nticular their inability to make naval interventions and the ineffectiveness of large\\narmies of some of their powers against smaller European forces) became mani-\\nfest and this had grave implications in the political history of the rest of the\\neighteenth century.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 16.2\\n1.\\nWhich battle during third Carnatic war ended almost a century of conflict over\\nsupremacy between the French and British powers in India?\\n2.\\nDiscuss the effects of the Carnatic wars?\\n3.\\nWhat were the causes of the British success in Carnatic wars?\\n16.3 BRITISH OCCUPATION OF BENGAL: PLASSEY TO\\nBUXAR  (1757–1765)\\nThe first major conflict of the British against an Indian power was in Bengal. The\\nhistory of Bengal from 1757 to 1765 is the history of gradual transfer of the power\\nfrom the nawabs to the British. During this short period of eight years three nawabs,\\nSiraj-ud- Daula, Mir Jafar and Mir Qasim ruled over Bengal but they failed to uphold\\nthe sovereignty of the nawab and ultimately the reign of control passed into the hands\\nof the British .The British, unable to compete with the Asian merchants in business,\\nresorted to force, taking control of Bengal in 1757 under the pretext of the “Plassey\\nrevolt”. The result was that the British achieved victory in Bengal, for their use of\\nforce led to the decline of the very trade they so longed to control. By the time Siraj-\\nud- Daula succeeded Ali Vardi Khan as nawab of Bengal in 1756 trade privileges and\\ntheir misuse by the Company and its officers had already become an issue of conflict.\\nThere was a privilege which had been granted to the Company for its export and\\nimport trade by the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar. According to this Imperial farman,\\nthe Company had to pay Rs. 3000 a year and in return could carry on trade duty- free\\nin Bengal. The Company’s servants extended this privilege to their own coastal trade,\\ninter- Asian trade and finally the inland trade. This was an obvious usurpation. Cer-\\ntain other factors like the fortification around Calcutta without the permission of the\\n4\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857\\nnawab and repeated defiance of the nawab’s authority along with sheltering the\\noffenders of the nawab were the acts on the part of the English Company which\\nprovoked the nawab. The Company officials also suspected that nawab was going\\nto have an alliance with the French in Bengal. Siraj-ud-Daula’s attack on Calcutta\\nprecipitated an open conflict. The British retaliation started with hatching a con-\\nspiracy against the nawab in alliance with his officers like Rai Durlabh, Ami Chand,\\nMir Jafar and Jagat Seth. So English victory in the battle of Plassey (23 June, 1757)\\nwas pre-decided. It was not the superiority of the military power but the conspiracy\\nthat helped the English in wining the battle. Mir Jafar, The commander-in-chief of\\nthe Nawab was awarded the Nawabship by Clive for his support to the English.\\nMir Jafar responded by paying a sum of Rs.One Crore and Seventy Seven lakhs\\n(17,700,000) to the Company and large sums to the Company officers as bribe. But\\nMir Jafar could not support the ever increasing demands of the English who were\\nalso suspicious about his collaboration with the Dutch Trading Company. Mir Jafar,\\nwho was made nawab  after the battle of Plassey, was deposed in 1760. Mir Qasim\\nwas placed on the throne by the British in the hope that he would be able to meet\\ntheir financial demands. The new Nawab assigned to them the district of Burdawan,\\nMidnapore and Chittagong for the expenses of the British army which was to\\nhelp him. This alliance was of great help to the British in their campaign against\\nthe French in 1760–1761; the money paid by Mir Qasim helped the Calcutta\\nCouncil to finance their war in South. The Nawab succeeded in establishing a\\nbetter system of administration. But he came into conflict with the British in\\nBengal on the question of a privilege i.e. duty free private trade of the Com-\\npany. Mir Qasim’s proposed plan about equal trade duties for British and In-\\ndian traders was turned down by the British council at Calcutta. Mir Qasim, in\\nthe circumstances, remitted all duties on Indians and the British alike for two\\nyears. This measure deprived the British private traders of the privileged posi-\\ntion they had created for themselves, they could not compete with Indian trad-\\ners on equal terms. The Nawab’s attempts to reorganize the army and shifting\\nof capital from Murshidabad to Monghyr were also taken as unforgivable of-\\nfences by the Company.\\nIn June 1763 under Major Adams British army defeated Mir Qasim the Nawab of\\nBengal. Mir Qasim fled to Patna and took help from Emperor Shah Alam II and Shuja-\\nud-Daula (Who was Nawab of Awadh and also the Wazir of the Mughal empire).\\nMatters came to a head when the chief of the Company’s factory at Patna, tried to\\nseize the city. This precipitated war. Mir Qasim, an excellent civil administrator, was no\\nmilitary leader. His army was defeated. When he was forced to withdraw to Awadh,\\nthe Nawab Wazir and emperor Shah Alam II decided to come to the defence of the\\neastern subas of the empire. The confederates advanced to Patna, and a battle was\\nfought at Buxar on October 22, 1764. With a decisive victory at Buxar, the British army\\noverran Awadh. The Nawab Wazir fled to the Rohilla country, but Shah Alam II came\\nto terms with the British. Lord Clive, then British Governor in Calcutta, also concluded\\ntreaty of Allahabad with the Shuja-ud-Daula Nawab Wazir of Awadh, who was to pay\\nfifty lakhs of rupees for the expenses of the war and was given back his dominions. He\\nentered into defensive alliance with the Company. Awadh became for the British a\\nbuffer state. Shah Alam II was now a fugitive- Delhi had now fallen into the hands of\\nthe Rohilla chief Najib-ud-daulah. The British gave emperor Shah Alam II possession\\nof Kara and Allahabad, while he granted them the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa\\nin return for a regular annual payment of twenty- six lakhs of rupees.\\n5\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n ESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 16.3\\n1.\\nThe ruler of Bengal in 1757 was:\\na.

The Mughal provincial administra-\\ntion had two main heads - nizamat and diwani. Broadly speaking, nizamat meant\\nadministration of law and order and criminal justice; while diwani was the rev-\\nenue administration and civil justice. The provincial Subadar was in charge of\\nnizamat (he was also called nazim) and the diwan was in charge of revenue\\nadministration. After the treaty of Allahabad the English East India Company\\nwas made the Diwan of Bengal but Lord Clive choose not to take over the ad-\\nministration of Bengal directly; this responsibility was left to the Nawab’s Naib\\nDiwan and Naib Nazim Muhammad Raza Khan. As naib nazim he was to repre-\\nsent the nawab and as naib diwan he was to represent the Company. Thus the\\nNawab had to handle the entire responsibility for the civil and criminal justice\\nadministration. However, he had to function through Muhammad Raza Khan who\\nwas placed under the superintendence, direction and control of the British Com-\\npany. As the Diwan, the Company directly collected its revenue, while through\\nthe right to nominate the Deputy Nazim, it controlled the nizamat or the Police\\nor Judicial powers. This arrangement is known as ‘Dual or Double Govern-\\nment’. Under this system British had power and resources without responsibility\\nwhile the Nawab had the responsibility of the administration without power to\\ndischarge it. Thus the Nawab had to take all responsibility for bad governance.\\nThe revenue remained the sole earning of the Company in lieu of a meager an-\\nnual payment to the Mughal emporer.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 16.4\\n1.\\nExplain the terms nizamat and diwani.\\n2.\\nWhat do you mean by Dual or Double Government?\\n3.\\nWhy did Lord Clive introduce system of Dual or Double Government?\\n7\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n ESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857\\n16.5 IDEOLOGY OF EXPANSION: TOOLS AND METHODS\\nShifting its role from a trading corporation, the English East India Company gradu-\\nally became supreme political power in India. There were other regional kingdoms\\nwhich were conquered by the British. Haidar Ali and his son Tipu Sultan  the leg-\\nendary rulers of Mysore (in Carnatic, modern day Indian state of Karnataka ), gave\\na tough time to the British forces in the second half of the eighteenth century.\\nHaidar Ali was in command of the army in Mysore from 1749; he became the ruler\\nof the state in 1761. Until his defeat by Sir Eyre Coote in 1781 Haidar Ali continued\\nhis struggle against the Company. Mysore finally fell to the Company forces in\\n1799, with the slaying of Tipu Sultan in 1799. With the gradual weakening of the\\nMaratha Empire in the aftermath of the three Anglo-Maratha wars fought during\\n1772-1818, the British also secured the Maratha territories. It was during these\\ncampaigns, both against Mysore and the Marathas, that under the command of\\nArthur Wellesley, the British had secured the entire region of Southern India (with\\nthe exception of small enclaves of French and local rulers), Western India and\\nEastern India.\\n The second method was the use of subsidiary agreements (sanad) between the\\nBritish and the local rulers. This development created what came to be called the\\nNative States, or Princely States. The Subsidiary Alliances system was also intro-\\nduced by Lord Wellesley in and after 1798. The British, under the subsidiary alliance\\nsystem, agreed to protect the Indian rulers against external threats and internal disor-\\nder but, in return, the Indian rulers who accepted the Subsidiary Alliance system\\nwere to agree to the stationing of British contingent for whose maintenance they\\nwould pay a subsidy to the British. The ruler under the system of alliance could\\nneither enter into alliance with any other power nor fight a war without prior permis-\\nsion from the British. A British resident was stationed at these ruling states that had\\nthe authority to interfere in state politics. This system was suited best to the advan-\\ntage of the British as, without even spending a single penny the British were able to\\nmaintain large forces. Moreover this system enabled the English to weed out the\\nforeign influence from the Indian courts. The Nizam of Hydrabad was first to enter\\ninto a subsidiary alliance with the English in 1798. He was forced to replace the\\nFrench officers from his court and put English officers in their place. He also granted\\nthe territories of Bellari and Cudappah to British for the maintenance of the army.\\nThe subsidiary alliances created the Princely States (or Native States) of the Maha-\\nrajas and the  Nawabs, prominent among which were: Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794),\\nTravancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798) and  Mysore (1799). The annexed regions\\nincluded the North Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the\\nDoab) (1801), Delhi (1803), and Sindh (1843). Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province,\\nand Kashmir, were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849. Kashmir was sold\\nunder the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu, and thereby\\nbecame a princely state. In 1854 Berar was annexed, and the state of Oudh two\\nyears later.

With the introduction of this policy of\\nlapse, the Company could establish absolute, imperial administrative control over many\\nregions spread over the subcontinent. The Company took over the princely states of\\nSatara, Jaitpur , Sambalpur, Nagpur and Jhansi using this Doctrine.

Free enterprise was a major demand. The\\nBritish Parliament enacted a series of laws among which the Regulating Act of 1773\\nstood first, to curb the Company traders’ unrestrained commercial activities and to\\nbring about some order in territories under the Company control. Limiting the Com-\\npany charter to periods of twenty years, subject to review upon renewal, this  act\\ngave the British government supervisory rights over the Bengal, Bombay, and Ma-\\ndras presidencies. The Regulating Act also created a unified administration for India,\\nuniting the three presidencies under the authority of the Bengal’s governor, who was\\nelevated to the new position of governor-general. Warren Hastings was the first\\nincumbent governor-general (1773–1785). The Pitt’s India Act of 1784 sometimes\\ndescribed as the “half-loaf system”, as it sought to mediate between Parliament and\\nthe company directors, enhanced Parliament’s control by establishing the Board of\\nControl, whose members were selected from the British cabinet. As governor-gen-\\neral from 1786 to 1793, Lord Cornwallis, professionalized, bureaucratized, and Euro-\\npeanized the company’s administration. He also outlawed private trade by company\\nemployees, separated the commercial and administrative functions, and enhanced the\\nsalaries of company’s servants.\\nAs revenue collection became the company’s most essential administrative func-\\ntion, Lord Cornwallis granted legal ownership of land to the zamindars in Bengal.\\nIn return, zamindars had to pay the government fixed revenue by a certain\\nparticular date. This arrangement was to last for ever; hence the title “perma-\\nnent settlement” was given. This system was also known as the zamindari sys-\\n11\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n ESTABLISHMENT OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA TILL 1857\\ntem. The immediate consequence was that as now zamindar became the owner\\nof the land, the peasant was reduced to the status of the tenant on his own land.\\nMoreover now land became a negotiable property and the state was excluded\\nfrom agricultural expansion and development, which came under the purview of\\nthe zamindars. In Madras and Bombay, however, the ryotwari (peasant) settle-\\nment system was set in motion, in which peasant cultivators had to pay annual\\ntaxes directly to the government.\\nThe Charter Act of 1813 ended the monopoly of the Company over trade with India.\\nThe Company’s control over revenue, administration and appointments remained un-\\ntouched. The Charter Act of 1833 abolished the Company’s monopoly of the China\\ntrade. The Act also deprived the presidencies of the power to make laws, concentrat-\\ning legislative power with the Governor-General and his council.\\nWith such expansion of the British territories and the increasing administrative responsi-\\nbilities, a bureaucracy was also required to control British possessions. In 1785, Lord\\nCornwallis created a professional cadre of Company servants who had generous sala-\\nries, had no private trading or production interests in India, enjoyed the prospect of regular\\npromotion and were entitled to pensions. All high-level posts were reserved for the Brit-\\nish, and Indians were excluded. Cornwallis appointed British judges, and established Brit-\\nish officials as revenue collectors and magistrates in each district of Bengal. From 1806\\nthe Company trained its young recruits in Haileybury College near London. Appointments\\nwere still organized on a system of patronage. In 1829 the system was strengthened by\\nestablishing districts throughout British India small enough to be effectively controlled by\\nan individual British official who henceforth exercised a completely autocratic power,\\nacting as revenue collector, judge and chief of police. After 1833 the Company selected\\namongst its nominated candidates by competitive examination. After 1853, selection was\\nentirely on merit and the examination was thrown open to any British candidate.

The Mayor’s Court was estab-\\nlished in 1727 for civil litigation in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. In 1772 an\\nelaborate judicial system, known as adalat, established civil and criminal juris-\\ndictions. Both Hindu pandits and Muslim qazis (Sharia court judges) were re-\\ncruited to aid the presiding judges in interpreting their customary laws, but in\\ngeneral, British common and statutory laws became applicable. The two main\\ntheoretical principles underlying the entire British judicial system in India were\\nthe notions of the Rule of Law and Equality before law; thus as per theory no\\none was above the law (certain rules which defined the rights, privileges and\\nobligations of the people) and all the citizens irrespective of their caste, class and\\nother status, were now equal before law. The principle of habeas corpus pro-\\nvided that no person could be arrested or kept in prison without a written order\\nfrom the local executive or the judicial authority. Even the Government servant,\\nif the acts done in their official capacity could be sued in the court of Law. The\\nnatural upshot of the Rule of Law was the Equality before the Law, which sub-\\nsequently followed the Rule of Law.

The first phase\\n(1757-1813) of ‘mercantilism’ was one of direct plunder in which surplus Indian\\nrevenues were used to buy Indian finished goods to be exported to England. In the\\nsecond phase (1813-1858) of free trade India was converted into a source of raw\\nmaterial and a market for British manufactured goods. The third phase (1858 on-\\nwards) was one of finance imperialism in which British capital controlled banks,\\nforeign trading firms and managing agencies in India. This phased exploitation was\\ncarried out through a range of economic policies, primarily in the industrial and agri-\\ncultural sectors of the colonial economy.\\n17.1 THE FIRST PHASE OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nThis ‘First Phase’ is generally dated from 1757, when the British East India Company\\nacquired the rights to collect revenue from its territories in the eastern and southern\\nparts of the subcontinent, to 1813, when the Company’s monopoly over trade with\\nIndia came to an end.\\n18\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nThe British had come to India in the seventeenth century, purely as a trading company,\\nbacked by an exclusive royal charter to trade with India, from their queen, Elizabeth I.\\nThey set up their first ‘factory’ on the banks of the Hughli River in Bengal. The Com-\\npany had managed to acquire permits or a ‘dastak’ from the Mughal emperor that\\nexempted it from having to pay duties on its trade. This led to a great deal of corruption\\namong the employees of the Company, as the ‘farman’ was widely misused by them for\\ntheir private trade. It also meant heavy losses in revenue for the Bengal governors\\n(later nawabs) in way of customs duties. This became a contentious issue and one of\\nthe chief factors, which led to the Battle of Plassey, fought in 1757.\\nThe primary function of the British East India Company in this period was to buy\\nspices, cotton and silk from India and sell them at huge profits to the large market\\nthese goods enjoyed in Britain. This meant that large quantities of bullion would flow\\nout of Britain into India to pay for these commodities. Despite efforts, it seemed\\ndifficult to find British goods that could be sold in India in exchange, to stem this\\noutflow of bullion. Besides the expenditure on buying commodities, the Company also\\nspent very large amounts on the wars that it had to fight with other European powers,\\nall in search of the same goods to trade in. These included the Portuguese, the Dutch\\nand the French. Thus the acquisition of ‘diwani’ (right to collect revenue) in Bengal,\\nafter the Battle of Buxar, which followed the Battle of Plassey, opened the way for\\nthe Company to raise money for its expenditure in India.\\nLAND REVENUE POLICIES\\nAfter the diwani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa was granted to the East India Company\\nin 1765, the maximization of revenue from the colony became the primary objective\\nof the British administration. Agricultural taxation was the main source of income for\\nthe company, which had to pay dividends to its investors in Britain. Therefore, the\\nBritish administration tried out various land revenue experiments to this aim. These\\nexperiments also partly determined the relationship that the colonial state would share\\nwith the people it governed.\\nIn 1772, the Governor of Bengal, Warren Hastings, introduced a system of revenue\\nfarming in the province of Bengal. In this system European District Collectors would\\n‘farm’ out the right to collect revenue to the highest bidder. This system was a total\\nfailure and ruined the cultivators because of the arbitrarily high revenue demands.\\nTo undo this disaster, Cornwallis introduced the system of Permanent Settlement\\nin 1793. Under this system, ‘zamindars’, who earlier only had the right to collect rev-\\nenue, were established as the proprietors or owners of land. The state’s demand for\\nland revenue was permanently fixed But if the zamindars were unable to pay the full tax\\non time, their lands would be taken away and auctioned by the state. Through this\\nsystem, the state tried to create an enterprising class of landowners, who would try to\\nimprove crop production in their fields to earn profits. Besides, it would be simpler for\\nthe state to deal with a limited number of zamindars than with every peasant, and a\\npowerful section of society would become loyal to the British administration.\\nBut this system led to greater impoverishment of the tenant-cultivator because of the\\nburden of high revenue assessment. It also caused great difficulty for zamindars,\\nmany of whom were unable to pay the revenue on time and lost their lands. A large\\nnumber of traditional zamindar houses collapsed. The system also encouraged\\nsubinfeudation i.e. many layers of intermediaries between the zamindar and\\ncultivator, adding to the woes of the peasantry.\\n19\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nTo keep out intermediaries from revenue collection, so that the state could acquire a\\nlarger share of the income from land, the Ryotwari System was started by Alexander\\nRead in 1792, for the Madras Presidency. Later it was introduced in the Bombay\\nPresidency as well. Under this system, revenue was initially collected from each\\nvillage separately, but later each cultivator or ‘ryot’ was assessed individually. Thus,\\npeasants not zamindars were established as property owners. Although this system\\nincreased the revenue collected by the state, the assessments were faulty and the\\npeasants overburdened by the taxes. The landed intermediaries continued to flourish.\\nIn the north and northwest of India the Mahalwari Settlement was followed after\\n1822 where the state made settlements with either the village community or, in some\\ncases, the traditional ‘taluqdar’. Each such fiscal unit was called a ‘mahal’. Under\\nthis system, some recognition was given to collective proprietary rights.\\nAs a result of the revenue policies of the British, agriculture stagnated and peasants\\nalmost became tenants at will. They also increased the number of landed intermediar-\\nies, and strongly entrenched the figure of the moneylender in the countryside. Landlords\\nand zamindars became an important class and collaborators of British colonial rule.\\nThe acquisition of diwani rights meant that the Company could now tap the wealth of\\nlocal rulers, zamindars and merchants in the rich province of Bengal and use them to\\nbuy the goods that would be shipped to Britain for sale. Large quantities of wealth,\\nincluding illegal incomes of company officials, made its way to Britain from Bengal.\\nCompany officials amassed huge fortunes before they returned home, and they were\\nreferred to as ‘nabobs’ in Britain, on account of their flashy lifestyles. A lot of this\\nmoney was used to fuel the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The greed for incomes\\nfrom land revenue also led the Company to pursue an aggressive policy of territorial\\nexpansion in India.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 17.1\\n1.\\nWhat were the three phases of colonization in British India?\\n2.\\nWhat was one of the chief factors that led to the Battle of Plassey?\\n3.\\nWith whom did the Company permanently settle the revenue in Bengal?\\n4.\\nIn which presidencies was the Ryotwari settlement first introduced?\\n17.2 THE SECOND PHASE OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\n(FREE TRADE)\\nThe ‘Second Phase’ is generally seen to have begun with the charter Act of 1813, when\\nthe Company lost its monopoly trading rights in India, and ended in 1858, when the British\\ncrown took over the direct control and administration of all British territory in India.\\n20\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nAs the Company’s profits grew, the support they enjoyed from the British govern-\\nment became precarious. Earlier many members of the parliament had ‘East Indian’\\ninterests, who used the Company’s resources to maintain their patronage within the\\ngovernment. But as unprecedented levels of industrialization were achieved in Brit-\\nain, there was a gradual change in the constitution of the parliament. Adam Smith’s\\nbook, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, heralded a\\nnew school of economic thought, which critiqued the idea of companies enjoying\\nexclusive monopolies and lobbied for a government policy of ‘free trade’ or ‘laissez\\nfaire’. In a bid to acquire greater control over the Company’s earnings, the parliament\\nstarted attacking individual Company officials with charges of ‘misconduct’. The\\n‘Free Traders’, dominant in the parliament with the turn into the 19th century, de-\\nmanded free access to India, which led to the passing of the Charter Act of 1813, thus\\nending the monopoly enjoyed by the Company in India, while subordinating its territo-\\nrial possessions to the overall sovereignty of the British crown.\\n‘Free Trade’ changed the nature of the Indian colony completely, through a dual\\nstrategy. Firstly it threw open Indian markets for the entry of cheap, mass-produced,\\nmachine-made British goods, which enjoyed little or almost no tariff restrictions. The\\npassage of expensive, hand-crafted Indian textiles to Britain, which had been very\\npopular there, was however obstructed by prohibitive tariff rates. And secondly Brit-\\nish-Indian territory was developed as a source of food stuff and raw material for\\nBritain, which fuelled rapid growth in its manufacturing sector, crucial to the emer-\\ngence of a powerful capitalist economy. These changes reversed the favourable\\nbalance of trade that India had enjoyed earlier. This phase laid the foundations of a\\nclassic colonial economy within India through the complex processes of commercial-\\nization of agriculture and deindustrialization, which are discussed below.\\nCOMMERCIALIZATION OF AGRICULTURE\\nIt is often believed that the colonial administration encouraged the commercialization of\\nagriculture that improved the position of peasants in many areas of the Indian colony.\\nFrom the 1860s onwards, the nature of agricultural production was determined by the\\ndemands of the overseas markets for Indian primary products. The items exported in the\\nfirst half of the nineteenth century included cash crops like indigo, opium, cotton and silk.\\nGradually raw jute, food grains, oil seeds and tea replaced indigo and opium. Raw cotton\\nremained the most in demand item. This expansion in cash crop production was accompa-\\nnied by the building of railways, after 1850, to improve trade networks.\\nBut commercialization seems to have been a forced artificial process that led to very\\nlimited growth in the agricultural sector. It led to differentiation within the agricultural\\nsector, but did not create the figure of the ‘capitalist landowner’ as in Britain. The\\nlack of any simultaneous large scale industrial development meant that accumulated\\nagrarian capital had no viable channels of investment, for it to be converted into\\nindustrial capital. Initiatives to expand the productive capacity and organization of\\nagriculture was also a risky proposition, as the sector catered to a distant foreign\\nmarket with wildly fluctuating prices, while the colonial state provided no protection\\nto agriculturists. Commercialization thus, increased the level of sub-infeudation in the\\ncountryside and money was channelised into trade and usury.\\nThe larger part of the profits generated by the export trade went to British business\\nhouses, which controlled shipping and insurance industries, besides commission agents,\\ntraders and bankers. Those who benefited in the colony were big farmers, some\\n21\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nIndian traders and moneylenders. Commercialization further intensified the feudal\\nstructure of landlord-moneylender exploitation in rural areas.\\nThe so called process of commercialization, which was supposed to lead to capitalist\\nagriculture, was often carried out through very exploitative and almost unfree forms of\\nlabour. Tea was grown in plantations in Assam, owned by whites, and they used inden-\\ntured labour, which was almost like slavery. White planters had to force farmers to\\ngrow indigo because it yielded low profits and upset the harvesting cycle. This involved\\ninhuman levels of coercion, which eventually led to the indigo-rebellion in 1859-60.\\nCommercialization did lead to limited phases of success in the cotton producing areas of\\nwestern India in 1860s and in jute production in eastern India, but they were because of\\nincreases in demand rather than capitalist innovation in production and organization.\\nFarmers were forced to grow cash crops also because they had to pay the high\\nrevenue, rents and debts in cash. The shift away from food crops like jowar, bajra and\\npulses to cash crops often created disaster in famine years. A decline in world de-\\nmand for Indian cotton led to heavy indebtedness, famine and agrarian riots in the\\nDeccan cotton belt in the 1870s. The jute industry collapsed in the 1930s, which was\\nfollowed by a devastating famine in 1943 in Bengal. Although, causes of these fam-\\nines have been widely debated by historians, it is undeniable that the aggregate pro-\\nduction of food crops remained far behind population growth, and millions of people\\ndied of starvation and epidemics.\\nAmong the limited steps that the colonial government took towards improving agri-\\ncultural productivity included the construction of some irrigation canals in northern,\\nnorth-eastern and south-western parts of India. ‘Permanently Settled’ eastern India got\\nleft out this government initiative, because there was no scope of increasing the revenue\\nany further. Thus revenue maximization and limited famine-relief in extreme situations\\nwere the factors that motivated this public investment. It did lead to great prosperity and\\ncommercial agriculture in limited enclaves, especially in the canal colonies of Punjab, but\\nFig. 17.1 Bengal Famine 1943\\n22\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nit was confined to a small number of already well-of farmers who could pay the high\\nwater rates. It also encouraged the cultivation of cash crops like sugar, cotton and wheat,\\nwhile reducing the production of millets and pulses. In some cases, like the United Prov-\\ninces, it did not suit local conditions and caused swamps and excessive salinity.\\nIn 1853, Lord Dalhousie took the decision to construct railways in India. Very often the\\nrailways have been seen as a marker of the modernization that took place under British\\nrule. But the construction of the railways in India only further strengthened the colonial\\nnature of India’s economic development. The railway network made it easier to pen-\\netrate the interior markets and sources of raw material in the colony and linked them to\\nport cities, instead of linking internal markets to each other. The railway network was\\nthus primarily geared to serve the interest of foreign trade. Railway lines built in frontier\\nregions would facilitate army movement and some “famine lines” were built in scarcity\\nareas. Moreover, the whole project was built with British capital, and investors in Brit-\\nain were guaranteed 5% interest, which was paid out of Indian revenue. Most of the\\nhigh level expertise and railway equipment like machinery, railway lines and even coal\\nto an extent, was imported from Britain. This ensured that the ‘multiplier’ effects of\\nconstructing the railways also remained absent in India.\\nAmongst other factors, the penetration of the interiors of the country, made possible\\nby the railways, had another grave fall out – the ruin of the Indian handicrafts indus-\\ntry, which had enjoyed patronage both from local ruling elites and markets overseas.\\nWith the expanding control of the British, traditional native courts disappeared. The\\nBritish also enforced an unequal tariff system, whereby the entry of Indian commodi-\\nties in British markets was restricted by high custom duties. In turn, the Industrial\\nRevolution in Europe enabled the mass production of cheap machine-made goods,\\nwhich flooded Indian markets. Unable to compete with this, Indian commodities lost\\nboth their overseas and domestic markets. This destructive process led to\\ndeindustrialisation that increased pressure on land.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 17.2\\n1.\\nWhich economist propounded the idea of free trade or laissez faire in the 18th\\ncentury?\\n2.\\nHow did the commercialization of agriculture cause famine?\\n3.\\nWhich region benefited most by the irrigation canals built by the British?\\n4.\\nHow did the Industrial Revolution in Britian lead to ‘deindustrialisation’ in British India?\\n17.3 THE THIRD PHASE OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nThe third phase is seen to have begun from the 1860s, when British India became part\\nof the ever-expanding British empire, to be placed directly under the control and\\nsovereignty of the British crown. This period was one of ‘finance-imperialism’, whensome\\n23\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nBritish capital was invested in the colony. This capital was organized through a closed\\nnetwork of British banks, export-import firms and managing agencies.\\nAlthough the process of colonization has been divided into stages, one should keep in\\nmind that this periodisation is in some ways arbitrary. The third phase was merely a\\nconsolidation of the trends that were already witnessed clearly in the second phase. It\\nmay be more useful to study these phases as heavily overlapping, where new and\\nmore subtle forms of exploitation existed alongside older, cruder forms. However, the\\nnew development that marked out the third phase was an intensification of the rivalry\\nbetween developed and industrialized countries, for colonies in Asia, Africa and Latin\\nAmerica. In the 19th century, countries like France, Belgium, Germany, the United\\nStates, and even Japan witnessed rapid industrialization. In the face of competition in\\nthe world market, Britian’s lead in this regard dwindled. In search for newer markets\\nand sources of raw material, these countries stepped up their drive for colonies and\\nstrengthened their control over existing ones. Industrial development also led to capi-\\ntal accumulation, which was concentrated in a small number of banks and corpora-\\ntions. This capital was invested in the colonies to sustain the rapid inflow of raw\\nmaterials to fuel further expansion of industrial production.\\nHigh tariff restrictions in other developing capitalist countries led to a contraction of\\nmarkets for British manufactured goods. And the need for heavy imports of agricul\\ntural products into Britain, was making her position vulnerable in her trade with other\\ncountries. India proved crucial in solving the problem of Britain’s deficits. Britain’s\\ncontrol over India ensured that there would always be a captive market for Lancashire\\ntextiles. Moreover, India’s export surplus in raw material with countries other than\\nBritain, counter-balanced her deficits elsewhere.\\nWhile on the one hand indigenous handicrafts faced impoverishment, on the other\\nhand, there were few attempts at developing modern industries in the colony. Al-\\nthough the colonial government spoke about ‘free trade’, indigenous enterprise faced\\nmany obstructions perpetuated by the state’s discriminatory policies. British capital\\nwas initially invested in railways, jute industry, tea plantations and mining. The Indian\\nmoney market was dominated by European banking houses. While British entrepre-\\nneurs had easy access to capital made available by this banking network, Indian\\ntraders had to depend on family or caste organizations for their capital needs. British\\nbanking houses and British trading interests were well organized through Chambers\\nof Commerce and Managing Agencies and could also influence the colonial state, to\\ncarefully deny Indian entrepreneurs access to capital. Before the First World War,\\nBritish Managing agencies controlled 75% of industrial capital, and most of the profits\\nfrom this limited industrialization were also sent back to Britain.\\nBut, inspite of heavy odds, Indian entrepreneurs found opportunities to expand and\\ngrow, whenever Britain underwent periods of economic hardship. It was during the\\nFirst World War that some Marwari businessmen from Calcutta, like G.D.Birla and\\nSwarupchand Hukumchand invested in the jute industry. Gradually their control started\\nexpanding into other areas like coal mines, sugar mills and paper industry, and they\\ncould even buy up some European companies. The greatest success of Indian capital\\nwas seen in the cotton industry in western India, which took advantage of high de-\\nmands during the war years (1914-18) to consolidate its successes, and eventually\\nwas in competition with Lancashire. Certain traditional trading communities like Gujarati\\nBanias, Parsis, Bohras and Bhatias became important in this sector. The Tata Iron\\n24\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nand Steel Company under government patronage provided leadership to the fledgling\\niron and steel company of India.\\nAfter the first world war, links with the foreign market was re-established, but again in\\nthe Depression years (1929–1933), the domestic market became relatively free to be\\nexploited by indigenous industry, as foreign trade declined. The colonial government\\nalso provided some protection to the sugar and cotton industries, in the face of falling\\nprices in the agricultural sector. Low prices forced capital from land into the manufac-\\nturing sector. Indians also ventured into the field of insurance and banking. Again, during\\nthe Second World War (1939–45), as foreign economic influence declined, Indian en-\\ntrepreneurs managed to make huge profits. Strengthened by its limited success, the\\nIndian capitalist class strengthened their links with the nationalist movement. They soon\\nstarted demanding the establishment of heavy industries under state ownership and\\nstarted organizing themselves to resist the entry of foreign capital.\\nBut, to place these markers of success in perspective, on an overall level, these devel-\\nopments remained confined to the domestic market and indigenous capital still had a\\nlong battle ahead, against the structural weaknesses of a colonial economy. The poten-\\ntial for growth remained depressed given the massive poverty of the Indian people.\\nEarly Indian nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, M.G. Ranade and R.C.Dutt had ex-\\npected Britain to undertake capitalist industrialization in India, but were deeply disillu-\\nsioned with the results of colonial industrial policies. Consequently, they formulated a\\nstrong economic critique of colonialism in the late nineteenth century. Dadabhai Naoroji\\nput forward the drain of wealth theory. Poverty in India, according to them, was the\\nresult of a steady drain of Indian wealth into Britain-a result of British colonial policy.\\nThis drain occurred through the interest that India paid for foreign debts of the East\\nIndia Company, military expenditure, guaranteed returns on foreign investment in\\nrailways and other infrastructure, importing all stationery from England, ‘home charges’\\npaid for the Secretary of State in Britain and salaries, pensions and training costs of\\nmilitary and civilian staff employed by the British state to rule India. Even if this drain\\nwas a small fraction of the value of India’s total exported, if invested within the\\ncountry it could have helped generate a surplus to build a capitalist economy.\\nThe ultimate question that has been asked of colonial economic policies in India is\\nwhether there had been any development at all. The answer to this question is not\\nsimple. We may start with looking at eighteenth-century Mughal India, before the\\nBritish had entrenched themselves as an invincible territorial power. The view that\\neighteenth century Mughal India was undergoing a deep economic crisis and decline\\nhas been pervasive among historians. It has been seen as the decisive broader con-\\ntext within which we may locate the decline of the Mughal empire. But some later\\nhistorians have refuted this view, and have instead drawn attention to the rise of new\\nrebellious groups into power, to account for the fall of the empire. They have argued\\nthat the Mughal period was in fact a period of over all well-being and economic\\ngrowth rather than stagnation or crisis. Within the political structure, there was suffi-\\ncient space and autonomy in the hands of local landed elites and urban guilds to\\ngenerate and accumulate surplus. Moradabad-Bareilly, Awadh. Banaras and Bengal\\nwere some such ‘surplus areas’. Forests were being cleared to expand cultivation.\\nConsequent rises in agricultural yield and the establishment of a cash nexus made\\nsurplus accumulation possible in the hands of erstwhile landlords and zamindars, who\\nchallenged Mughal paramountcy to emerge as the new regional power elite.\\n25\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 17.3\\n1.\\nWhich world event provided Indian entrepreneurs the first opportunity to expand\\nand grow?\\n2.\\nWho propounded the ‘drain of wealth’ theory?\\n3.\\nHave later historians seen the 18th century as a period of economic backwardness?\\nThus, the picture we get of India is one of a buoyant economic climate with a\\nreasonable potential for growth. How do we then explain the backwardness and\\npoverty that we encounter, at the end of the subsequent 200 years of British colo-\\nnialism? Some writers have argued that the British did try to partially ‘modernize’\\nIndia, but it failed because of the strong hold of traditional structures. But we have\\nnoted above that these half-hearted attempts at ‘modernisation’ were motivated\\nprimarily to benefit the ‘mother country’. Backwardness in the ‘peripheral’ colo-\\nnies needs to be seen as the necessary flip side of the Industrial Revolution in the\\n‘core’, centred on the West. The same processes that led to industrialization in\\nBritain, generated and sustained backwardness in her Indian colony, because the\\nBritish economy was linked parasitically to the Indian economy, in an integrated\\nworld economic system of ‘free trade’.\\nIndia in 1947 was not at a pre-industrial stage, and so her post-independence eco-\\nnomic growth patterns may not be compared with processes of industrialization in the\\nWest. In 1947, India had already been a part of capitalist development in the west for\\n200 years, but in capacity of a colony. So, in 1947, independent India embarked into a\\nprocess of modernization from a ‘colonial’ mode rather than a ‘traditional’ mode,\\nwhich was structurally backward and underdeveloped.\\nWHAT HA\\nVE YOU LEARNT\\nPhased economic exploitation of the colony was the core motive for the British to\\nestablish their rule in the Indian subcontinent. The nature of this exploitation changed\\nover the course of their reign, owing to changes within Britain, and these in turn had\\nspecific economic, social and political consequences for the colony. Most economic\\ninitiatives undertaken by the colonial state was couched in the language of development\\nand ‘modernisation’, but they had a differential impact on the colony, often leading to\\nbackwardness rather than growth. And finally most of these initiatives helped exploit\\nthe resources of the country to enable industrialization in Europe.\\nTERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nWhat were the revenue policies introduced by the British, and what changes did\\nthey bring about in the countryside in the colony?\\n2.\\nWhy was the commercialization of agriculture in the colony a ‘forced’ process?\\n26\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BRITISH COLONIALISM\\n3.\\nExplain the phase of ‘finance imperialism’.\\nANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS\\n17.1\\n1.\\nThe first phase (1757-1813) of ‘mercantilism’ was that of direct plunder, the\\nsecond phase (1813-1858) was that of free trade and the third phase (1858\\nonwards) was that of finance imperialism.\\n2.\\nThe misuse of the ‘dastak’ by Company employees for their private trade an-\\ngered the Nawab of Bengal\\n3.\\nZamindars\\n4.\\nMadras and Bombay Presidencies\\n17.2\\n1.\\nAdam Smith\\n2.\\nThe production of cash crops was encouraged at the cost of food crops.\\n3.\\nPunjab\\n4.\\nCheap machine made goods from Britain flooded the markets in India, and In-\\ndian handicrafts could not compete with them.\\n17.3\\n1.\\nThe First World War\\n2.\\nDadabhai Naoroji\\n3.\\nNo, later historians have charactersied the 18th century as a period of general\\nwell-being and economic growth.\\nHINTS FOR TERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nSee section 17.1 ‘Land Revenue Policies’\\n2.\\nSee section 17.2 ‘Commercialisation of Agriculture’\\n3.\\nSee section 17.3 ‘The Third Phase of British Colonialism’\\nGLOSSARY\\n1.\\nMercantilism\\n–\\nan economic theory followed in Europe between\\nthe 16th and 18th centuries, in which states used\\nwarfare to ensure an inflow of bullion, and con-\\ntrol trade and resources through colonies\\n2.

The onset of British rule, increasing urge for social and religious reform, rise of\\na middle class, rapid growth of newspapers in both English and Indian languages,\\nchanges in physical infrastructure and semi-political unification of the country were\\npartly responsible for these changes. The end of the Mughal rule was followed by the\\nstrengthening of many regional kingdoms during the 18th century. The gradual expan-\\nsion of British rule in this vacuum signified an entirely unfamiliar system of gover-\\nnance with long term repercussions.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\ntrace the broad outlines of cultural policies of British rulers in India;\\n \\nexamine the nature of the conflict between the Orientalists and the Anglicists;\\n \\nassess the impact of British rule on educated classes in India;\\n \\nexplore the evils in the social and religious life;\\n \\nexplain the background of the rise of a modern Indian intelligentsia;\\n \\nthe reform movements and the issues raised by them;\\n \\nidentify the stages of the growth of western education in India and\\n \\nidentify the stages of the growth of press in India.\\n18.1 BRITISH CULTURAL POLICIES IN INDIA\\nThe beginning of British rule in India witnessed many imperial ideologies in operation.\\nBack home in England, there were divergent ideologies at work regarding best pos-\\nsible ways of governing the Empire. Policies were often driven by the popularity of\\nspecific ideologies in Europe in general and England in particular. They also depended\\nupon the whims and fancies of higher British authorities in India. After the battles at\\nPlassey (1757) and Buxar (1764), British rulers faced many difficulties in governing\\nthe regions they had won. It will be very interesting to see that different ideologies\\ntook centre stage at different times.\\n29\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nOrientalists\\nThe first generation of British administrators in India like Warren Hastings, William\\nJones and Jonathan Duncan popularised the view that India had a glorious past which\\nhad subsequently degenerated. These scholars and administrators were called\\nOrientalists. They were keen to learn and propagate Indian languages and tradition.\\nThis, they thought, would ensure a better understanding of India which would eventu-\\nally strengthen their rule over this country. To stretch this argument further, we can\\nsay that the Orientalists depicted India’s past in a way that was in consonance with\\nthe needs of the colonial administration. Important institutions that came to be identi-\\nfied with their efforts were the Calcutta Madrassa founded by Warren Hastings\\n(1781), the Asiatic Society of Bengal founded by William Jones (1784) and the\\nSanskrit College at Benaras founded by Jonathan Duncan (1794).\\nWilliam Jones learnt Indian classical languages and found important linguistic con-\\nnection between Sanskrit and classical western languages like Greek and Latin. For\\naround fifty years, the Asiatic Society was an important centre of learning and a rare\\ninstitution to undertake translations of notable Sanskrit texts. An important journal\\npublished by it was the Asiatick Researches. Warren Hastings held the view that\\nHindus possessed laws which continued unchanged for centuries. Therefore, the Brit-\\nish should master these laws and the Sanskrit language in which these texts were\\nwritten if they wished to establish their governance in the country.  To provide a\\nprecise idea of the customs and manners of Hindus, N. B. Halhed published A Code\\nof Gentoo Laws in 1776.\\nThere was a strong urge to make local British administrators familiar with Indian\\nculture and tradition. Fort William College founded by Wellesley in 1801 to train the\\nyoung British recruits to the civil service in India was meant to serve primarily this\\npurpose. This college became an important centre for producing knowledge on and\\nabout India. It had many departments devoted exclusively to research on Indian lan-\\nguages and literature.\\nInfluence of Ideas on administrative and economic policies\\nInfluence of ideas was clearly visible in the administrative and economic policies.\\nLord Cornwallis, who became Governor General in 1786, was influenced by the 18th\\ncentury Whig political philosophy. In the Whig philosophy, the main organs of the\\ngovernment, i.e. executive, legislative and judiciary should be separate. This would\\nprovide check and balance on each other’s activity so that no organ exercises arbi-\\ntrary powers. Philip Francis and Edmund Burke were the two most eminent political\\nthinkers of the 18th century England. Burke insisted that the prosperity of the natives\\nmust be secured before any attempt was made to reap profit from them. Philip Francis,\\nhis friend and a member of the Supreme Council in Calcutta in the 1770s, drew up a\\ncomprehensive plan for administering property in Bengal. This plan subsequently in-\\nfluenced Cornwallis’ policy of Permanent Settlement for Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in\\n1793. Cornwallis succeeded in laying the foundation of a strong Whig policy in the\\ngovernance of Bengal. You will read more about the policy of Permanent Settlement\\nin the chapter dealing with economic history of British period.\\nEngland was the first country to experience Industrial Revolution which led to a mas-\\nsive increase in the output of finished products.

India had a long tradition of religious reforms\\nand social dissent. During the ancient period, an urge for reform can be seen in\\nUpanishadic texts, Buddhism, Jainism, Vajrayan, Tantricism etc. During the medieval\\nage, the popularity of the Bhakti and the Sufi saints is well known. Attempts to explore\\nIndia’s past by the first generation of British rulers helped to sharpen educated classes’\\nconsciousness of their own existence. Early reformers were groping to find suitable\\nanswers. But the agenda for the modernization was not set by the western influence\\nbecause the logic for reform was sought to be located within India’s past.\\nBENGAL RENAISSANCE\\nReform movements which took deep roots within Bengal have often been termed as\\nBengal Renaissance. Bankim Chandra Chatterji and Bipin Chandra Pal referred to\\ndevelopments in the 19th century Bengal as a period of Renaissance. It may not be\\nproper to compare European Renaissance with developments in Bengal as the con-\\ntext was entirely different and the patterns not too similar. However, the features\\nwhich were referred to while talking of a Bengal Renaissance may be clubbed under\\nthree major categories, i.e. historical rediscovery, linguistic and literary modernization\\nand socio-religious reforms.\\nBRAHMO SAMAJ\\nRammohan Roy from Bengal was the most notable reformer of the modern times.\\nHe was among the first to bring political questions in the ambit of public debate. His\\n31\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nAtmiya Sabha, founded in 1814, discussed important social and political questions of the\\ntime. In 1828, its enlarged edition was called the Brahmo Sabha which was renamed\\nBrahmo Samaj later on. Soon he started touching upon many burning social issues of\\nthe time including the widely-prevalent practice of becoming sati. He rallied support to\\nthe efforts of William Bentinck (Governor General) for abolition of this custom and\\nwrote extensively for the cause. In 1829, the custom of sati was formally abolished. He\\nalso condemned polygamy and many other forms of subjugation of women. Roy was\\nalso an advocate of modern education. He opened an English school as well as a\\nVedanta college (1825). He was a firm believer in the concept of one God. He was\\nopposed to idolatry and found Upanishads as the basis of true Hinduism. He wished to\\npurify Hinduism by removing all kinds of evils that had crept into it over centuries. He\\nwas not opposed to English education and spread of western knowledge.\\nAfter Roy’s death in 1833, the Brahmo Samaj started getting disorganized. It was\\ngiven a definite shape and popularized beyond the city of Calcutta under the leader-\\nship of Debendranath Tagore who joined in 1842. A year later, he wrote Brahmo\\nCovenant. This Covenant was a statement of the creed of the Samaj and made a list\\nof the duties and obligations of its members.\\nKeshab Chandra Sen (1838–84) who joined the Samaj in 1858 was a very eloquent\\nand persuasive leader. He took the activities of the Samaj beyond Bengal and into UP,\\nPunjab, Madras and Bombay. He radicalized the Samaj by attacking caste system,\\nunderlining women’s rights, promoting widow remarriage and raising the issue of\\ncaste status of Brahmo preachers which was earlier reserved for Brahmans. He laid\\nstress on universalism in religion. His radicalism brought him into opposition with\\nFig 18.1 Raja Ram Mohan Roy\\n32\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nSOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nDebendranath. In 1866, the Samaj was formally divided into Adi Brahmo Samaj (headed\\nby Debendranath) and the Brahmo Samaj of India (headed by Keshab Chandra).\\nISHWARCHANDRA VIDYASAGAR\\nAnother Bengali reformer who actively raised the issues related to women was\\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar. He was an active proponent of education of girl child\\nas he believed that lack of education was the real cause underlying all their problems.\\nWith the help of an Englishman named Bethun, he set up many schools devoted\\nespecially to girl child. He forcefully attacked child marriage and polygamy. He was\\na strong advocate of widow remarriage. It was due to his active mobilization of\\nsupport that the Widows’ Remarriage Act was passed in 1856 legalizing all widow\\nremarriages. He arranged many such remarriages. He set a personal example when\\nhis son Narayan also married a widow.\\nFig 18.2 Ishwarchandra\\nVidhyasagar\\nRamakrishna Mission\\nDuring the late 19th century, another notable reform movement in Bengal, which soon\\nspread to other parts of the country, was the Ramakrishna Mission. The movement\\nbegan under an ascetic and priest Gadadhar Chatterjee or Swami Ramakrishna\\nParamhansa (1836–86) who achieved inner peace around 1871–2. He preached\\nuniversality of all religions and favoured preserving beliefs and rituals of Hinduism.\\nAmong his important disciples was Narendra Nath or Swami Vivekananda who\\naccepted Ramakrishna as his guru in 1885. He spread the message of spiritual Hindu-\\nism in America and Europe during his tour of 1893–97. He established Ramakrishna\\nMission in 1897 and set up a Math at Belur. He died at a young age of forty in 1902.\\nVivekananda was opposed to degeneration in religion, manifold divisions, caste rigidi-\\nties, practice of untouchability, superstitions etc. He pointed out that the present\\ncondition of Hindus was due to their ignorance which was helped by their being a\\nsubject race. He attempted to establish Hindu spiritual supremacy vis-à-vis the selfish\\ncivilization of the West. However, he believed that India had to learn work ethics,\\nforms of organization and technological advances from the West.\\nREFORM MOVEMENTS IN WESTERN INDIA\\nMany important reform movements arose during the 19th century western India. Re-\\nformers like KT Telang, VN Mandalik and RG Bhandarkar glorified India’s past.\\nThere were some who led a direct attack on social evils like caste system and en-\\ncouraged widow remarriage, e.g. Karsondas Mulji and Dadoba Pandurang. They\\nformed Manav Dharma Sabha in 1844 and Paramhansa Mandali in 1849. The Mandali\\ncarried its activities secretly. Its members took a pledge that they would abandon all\\n33\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\ncaste distinctions. The Mandali declined after 1860 as its membership and activities lost\\nsecrecy. Keshab Chandra Sen’s twin visits to Bombay in 1864 and 1867 had a deep\\nimpact on social reform in this part. A direct consequence of his visits was the founding of\\nthe Prarthana Samaj in 1867 by Atmaram Pandurang. Mahadev Govind Ranade, who ran\\nthe Deccan Education Society, was the real force working behind this organization. Sev-\\neral members of the Prarthana Samaj had earlier been active in the Paramhansa Mandali.\\nThis Samaj denounced idolatry, priestly domination, caste rigidities and preferred mono-\\ntheism. Apart from Hindu sects, it also drew upon Christianity and Buddhism. It sought\\ntruth in all religions. Drawing inspiration from the Maratha Bhakti saints of the medieval\\nperiod, Ranade sought to establish the concept of one compassionate God.\\nArya Samaj\\nThe most profound reform movement in the late 19th century India was the Arya\\nSamaj. It started in the western India and the Punjab, and gradually spread to a large\\npart of the Hindi heartland. It was founded by Dayanand Saraswati (1824-83). In\\n1875, he wrote Satyarth Prakash (or the light of truth) and in the same year founded\\nthe Bombay Arya Samaj. The Lahore Arya Samaj was founded in 1877. Subse-\\nquently, Lahore became the epicentre of the Arya movement. Dayanand opposed a\\nritual-ridden Hindu religion and called for basing it on the preaching of the Vedas.\\nOnly Vedas, along with their correct analytical tools, were true. He attacked puranas,\\npolytheism, idolatry and domination of the priestly class. He adopted Hindi for reach-\\ning out to the masses. He also opposed child marriage. He was fiercely opposed to\\nmultiplicity of castes which he thought was primarily responsible for encouraging\\nconversion of lower castes into Christianity and Islam.\\nAfter Dayanand’s death in 1883, the Samaj lay scattered. Most important attempt to\\nunite the Samaj and its activities was the founding of the Dayanand Anglo Vedic\\nTrust and Management Society in Lahore in 1886. In the same year, this society\\nopened a school with Lala Hansraj as its principal. However, some leaders of the\\nSamaj were opposed to Anglo Vedic education. They were Munshi Ram (Swami\\nShraddhanand), Gurudatt, Lekh Ram and others. They argued that the Arya Samaj’s\\neducational initiative must focus on Sanskrit, Aryan ideology and Vedic scriptures and\\nshould have little space for English learning. This militant wing thought that Dayanand’s\\nwords were sacrosanct and his message in Satyarth Prakash could not be ques-\\ntioned. While the moderate wing led by Lala Hansraj and Lajpat Rai pointed out that\\nDayanand was a reformer and not a rishi or sadhu. Conflicts also arose over the\\ncontrol of the DAV Management Society. These differences finally led to a formal\\ndivision of the Arya Samaj in 1893 when Munshiram broke away along with his\\nsupporters to initiate a gurukul-based education. Therefore, after 1893 the two wings\\nof the Arya Samaj were-DAV group and Gurukul group.\\nMunshi Ram and Lekh Ram devoted themselves to popularizing of the teachings of\\nthe Vedas and began an Arya Kanya Pathsala at Jalandhar to safeguard education\\nfrom missionary influence. In 1902, Munshi Ram founded a Gurukul at Kangri in\\nHaridwar. This institute became the centre of the gurukul education wing of the Arya\\nSamaj in India. It was here that Munshi Ram adopted sanyas and became Swami\\nShraddhanand. The two wings of the Arya Samaj, i.e. DAV wing and the Gurukul\\nwing had differences on the question of education but were united on important politi-\\ncal and social issues of the time. The Arya Samaj as a whole opposed conversion of\\nHindus to Islam and Christianity and therefore advocated re-conversion of recent\\nconverts to Hinduism. This process was called shuddhi. They also advocated greater\\n34\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nSOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nusage of Hindi in Devanagari script. In the 1890s, the Arya Samaj also raised the\\nissue of cow slaughter and formed gaurakshini sabhas (or the cow protection soci-\\neties) for protection of cows. The Arya Samaj led a prolonged movement against\\nuntouchability and advocated dilution of caste distinctions.\\nREFORM MOVEMENTS AMONG MUSLIMS\\nThere was a sense of loss of power among educated and elite Muslims of India. This\\nhappened mainly because of-(i) transfer of power from Mughals to British, and\\n(ii) replacement of Persian by English as the language of employment and advance-\\nment in the new bureaucracy. The movement of the Farazis which arose among the\\npeasants of early 19th century Bengal advocated return to pure Islam. They followed\\nthe teachings of Shah Walliullah of Delhi (1703–63) who had, a century earlier, talked\\nabout regaining purity of Islam and objected to infiltration of non-Islamic customs\\namong Muslims. Founding leader of the Farazis, Shariat Ullah (1781–1839) preached\\nreligious purification and advocated return to the faraiz, i.e. obligatory duties of\\nIslam, namely-kalimah (profession of faith), salat (or namaz), sawn ( or rozah),\\nzakat (or alms to poor) and Hajj. He also preached tawhid or monotheism. Another\\nmovement which arose among Muslims of Bengal was the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah\\nunder the leadership of Titu Mir who was initiated by Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi. This\\nmovement also talked about return to past purity. Another movement which was more\\nconcerned about the decline in power of the ulema class (Muslim priestly class) arose\\nat Deoband in the United Provinces.\\nDelhi School of Islamic Thought was derived from the Delhi College (currently Zakir\\nHusain College) which had begun imparting a parallel education- Islamic as well as\\nEnglish. Beginning 1830s, the college helped to foster a modern consciousness in the\\nMuslim community. However, the revolt of 1857 and consequent crackdown by the\\nBritish forces ended this intellectual excitement. However, the urge for moderniza-\\ntion could easily be felt among a section of Muslims.\\nThe new leadership was provided by Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817–98) who rightly\\nthought that modern education was the most important path for improvement in the\\ncondition of Indian Muslims. He called for the study of European science and tech-\\nnology. In 1866, he formed the British Indian Association. He stayed in England for\\nmore than a year during 1869-70. On his return, he asked his Muslim brethren to\\nadopt some positive features of the English society like its discipline, order, efficiency\\nand high levels of education. He pointed out that there was no fundamental contradic-\\ntion between Quran and Natural Science and the new circumstances demanded dis-\\nsemination of English language within an Islamic context. He founded the Moham-\\nmedan Anglo Oriental College at Aligarh in 1875 which went on to become the most\\nimportant seminary for modern higher education among Muslims. At the elementary\\nlevel, students followed the standard government curriculum in a carefully constructed\\nIslamic environment. In 1878, the college classes were also started and non-Muslims\\nwere also enrolled. In 1886, Sayyid Ahmad Khan founded the Mohammadan Anglo\\nOriental Educational Conference. The Muslim graduates of Aligarh who numbered\\n220 during 1882–1902, provided lot of excitement to the Muslim intellectual world and\\nin due course of time provided an able and modern leadership to the community.\\nImpact of reform movements\\nReform movements of the 19th century set a strong background for the national\\nliberation movement against the British imperialism. Some women reformers also\\n35\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nplayed a prominent role in the social life of the 19th century. One may mention such\\nnames as Pandita Ramabai in western part, Sister Subbalaksmi in Madras and Rokeya\\nSakhawat Hossain in Bengal. Reform movements  helped the growth of a modern\\nmiddle class which was conscious of its rights. Some Indian reformers also protested\\nBritish attempts to pass those laws which they thought interfered with their religion and\\nsociety.  This was evident in the case of the Age of Consummation of marriage by\\nraising the age of consent from 10 to 12.  We can also see that some of these reform\\nmovements, by raising issues which were in conflict with interests of other communities\\nor were revivalist in nature, also worked towards polarization along communal lines.\\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 18.2\\n1.\\nBriefly examine some important issues raised by Rammohan Roy.\\n2.\\nAnalyse the nature of conflict between Debendranath Tagore and Keshab\\nChandra Sen.\\n3.\\nWhen was the Arya Samaj divided?

This could\\nstrengthen their roots in this country. Besides, it would also create a class of Indians\\nwho might act as reliable agents of the British Empire. English education was the\\nmost important medium of achieving these objectives. Several attempts were made\\nthroughout 19-20th centuries to popularize English education and make structural\\nchanges accordingly. Initially, the Orientalist administrators and scholars like Warren\\nHastings, Cornwallis, William Jones, Jonathan Duncan and others attached more im-\\nportance to Indian classical education but gradually their ideas lost ground. It was\\nthought that British Empire had to fulfill a civilizing mission in India and therefore\\nwestern sciences and culture needed to be popularized.\\nINTRODUCTION OF ENGLISH EDUCATION & CHARTER ACT OF 1813\\nEnglish education was first introduced in India in 18th century through some charity\\nschools in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay for educating European and Anglo-Indian\\nchildren. Although the East India Company supported these schools in various ways\\nbut it did not take any responsibility for teaching English to the Indian population. The\\nbeginning was finally made in the year 1813 through a Charter Act. This Act al-\\nlowed missionaries to travel to India. These missionaries were always keen to spread\\n36\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nSOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nwestern literature and teachings of Christianity through English medium. More\\nimportantly, this Act asked the company to spend one lakh rupees annually for-\\n (i). encouraging Indian educated classes, reviving and improvement of literature and\\n(ii). promotion of sciences among Indians. However, this clause was interpreted dif-\\nferently by different people.\\nDEBATE ON MEDIUM OF EDUCATION AND ROLE OF MACAULAY\\nVery soon a debate arose about the choice to be made with regard to the medium of\\neducation in India on which the company’s government was to spend. There were\\nimpassioned debates between the votaries of Oriental and English systems. Things\\nstarted drifting in favour of English education when Bentinck took over as the Governor\\nGeneral of India in 1828. T.B. Macaulay was appointed as the Law Member in his\\nCouncil in 1834. Macaulay was a great advocate of English education. He was made\\nPresident of the General Committee of Public Instruction. Supporters of English based\\neducation or Anglicists, led by Lord Macaulay, emerged victorious. Macaulay issued his\\nminutes on Indian education on February 2, 1835. This message became the guiding\\nprinciple for introduction of English education in India. The government resolved that its\\naim in future would be promotion of European literature and sciences through the me-\\ndium of English language. In future, all funds spent by the Company on education would\\nbe for this purpose alone. This shift meant that now English education in India would\\nbecome an important medium for the import of western knowledge.\\nMacaulay was of the opinion that support to English education in India would create “a\\nclass of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste.” It was presumed that this\\nclass would eventually become strong pillars of the British Raj in India. It was expected\\nthat these Indians, trained through English education, would learn western morality and\\nethics. When incorporated into the structure of colonial rule, these Indians would help to\\nstrengthen the British domination of India. This was the “downward filtration” theory.\\nThis kind of education was not meant for the masses but for the learned and affluent few\\nin India. This theory assumed that ethics of English education would percolate down to the\\nmasses through these Indians. These trained Indians, when acting as teachers, could act\\nas the medium through which elementary education would percolate downward in re-\\ngional languages. Macaulay was convinced that with limited funds, it would be impossible\\nto attempt to educate the masses. It is better that a few English educated Indians act as a\\n“class of interpreters”. This class, by enriching vernacular languages and literature, would\\nhelp western sciences and literature reach the masses. This would enable British rulers to\\nspread western morality to Indian masses at a much less public expenditure. This theory\\nalso saw education as a means to enable Indians to occupy subordinate positions and\\nfunction as clerks etc. in the Company’s bureaucracy.\\nWOOD’S DISPATCH\\nThe most important part of the development of education in 19th century, especially\\nEnglish education, was the guidelines prepared by Charles Wood, the Secretary of\\nState, in 1854, popularly known as the Wood’s Dispatch. This comprehensive scheme\\ndominated education policy in the second half of the 19th century. It firmly put the\\nEuropean model on the map of Indian education.\\nIts essential features:\\n•\\nIt declared the aim of education in India to be diffusion of European knowledge.\\n•\\nFor higher education, English would be the preferred medium of instruction while\\n37\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nthe vernacular languages would be the medium through which European knowl-\\nedge could infilter to the masses.\\n•\\nIt proposed a hierarchy of schools, i.e. vernacular primary schools at the village\\nlevel, followed by Anglo-Vernacular high schools and an affiliated college at the\\ndistrict level.\\n•\\nThis Dispatch recommended grants-in-aid for the first time to encourage private\\nefforts in the field of education.\\n•\\nIt proposed to set up a Department of Public Instruction to be headed by a\\nDirector, one in each of the five provinces under the British rule. This Depart-\\nment would review the progress of education in the particular province.  The\\nDepartment of Public Instruction was established in 1855 and replaced the Com-\\nmittee of Public Instruction and Council of Education.\\n•\\nIt proposed to set up universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras on the model\\nof London University which would hold examinations and confer degrees. The\\nuniversities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were established in 1857.\\n•\\nApart from the formal education, the Dispatch underlined the importance of voca-\\ntional education and emphasized the need to set up technical schools and colleges.\\n•\\nIt also recommended setting up of training institutes for prospective teachers.\\n•\\nIt also supported education for women. Many modern girls’ schools were set up\\nsubsequently and also received government’s grants-in-aid.\\nHUNTER COMMISSION\\nA commission was set up in 1882 under W.W. Hunter to review the progress made in the\\nfield of education following Wood’s Dispatch. It was confined mostly to\\nsecondary and primary education. The Hunter Commission made a large number of\\nrecommendations. It laid special emphasis on primary education whose control ought to\\nbe transferred to district and municipal boards. At the secondary level, there should be two\\nstreams-one literary education which should lead to university education and the other of\\na practical nature leading to a career in commercial or vocational field. Private initiative in\\nthe field of education should be encouraged. It underlined the need to provide adequate\\nfacilities for spread of women education outside the presidency towns. For the next two\\ndecades, the recommendations of the Hunter Commission showed its impact all over. It\\nsaw unforeseen growth in secondary and collegiate education. The Punjab University and\\nthe Allahabad University were founded in 1882 and 1887 respectively.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 18.3\\n1.\\nWhich Act asked the East India Company to spend one lakh rupees annually on\\neducation?\\n2.\\nWho was the most active proponent of English education in India?\\na.

The spread of printing technology meant\\nthat books were easily available. In other words, widespread printing opened new chan-\\nnels of communications across India. This new printing technology helped the growth of\\npress and journalism. The newspapers began getting published in English language in\\nthe late 18th century. During the 19th century, a large number of newspapers in local\\nlanguages also started. James Augustus Hickey published the first newspaper in India\\nnamed The Bengal Gazette in 1780. It was followed by a series of newspapers from\\nBengal, Bombay and Madras. Some important papers were The Calcutta Chronicle\\n(1786), The Madras Courier (1788), and The Bombay Herald (1789).\\nThese early newspapers in English were meant primarily for the European and Anglo-\\nIndian community staying in India. However, the Company’s officials were concerned\\nabout news of their misdoings appearing in these papers. Therefore, restrictions were\\noften imposed. Lord Wellesley (1796–1804) imposed strict regulations through the Cen-\\nsorship of the Press Act in 1799. This Act warranted that all content was to be cleared\\nby the Secretary to the Government. Names of the printer, editor and proprietor were to\\nbe clearly printed in every issue. Lord Hastings (1813–23) relaxed some of these laws\\nin 1818 and removed the pre-censorship of the press. However, these relaxations proved\\ntemporary as John Adams, who became acting Governor General in 1823, imposed\\nsome tough regulations on Press in the same year. License was made mandatory for\\nstarting or using a press. The Governor General reserved the right to cancel a license.\\nThe officiating Governor General, Charles Metcalfe (1835–36) was a supporter of free\\npress. He removed the regulations of 1823. Metcalfe’s Press Act just wanted publishers\\nto give a declaration about the place and premises of the publication. This liberating influ-\\nence had a positive impact on the growth of press as a large number of newspapers\\nstarted publishing till stiff regulations were again imposed in 1857 due to the Revolt. Most\\nserious restriction on the growth of Indian language newspapers was Lord Lytton’s Ver-\\nnacular Press Act of 1878. A highly biased and racial measure, this Act attempted to\\nstifle any opposition to the government voiced in the local languages of the country. Similar\\nrestrictions were not imposed on the English language newspapers. It was an important\\nexample of Lytton’s conservative and arrogant attitude. It indirectly empowered the gov-\\nernment to control all seditious writings by Indian intelligentsia. There was no appeal\\n39\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n SOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nagainst the decision of the District Magistrate. This Act was repealed in 1882 by Lord\\nRipon who was a very popular Viceroy among Indians for his liberal views and measures.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 18.4\\n1.\\nWhich was the first newspaper in India and when was it published?\\n2.\\nUnderline the importance of widespread use of printing technology in the growth\\nof newspapers.\\n3.\\nWhat restrictions were imposed by the Censorship of the Press Act, 1799?\\n4.\\nHow did Charles Metcalfe bring about some positive changes?\\n5.\\nWhat was the Vernacular Press Act of 1878?\\nWHAT YOU HA\\nVE LEARNT\\nYou have learnt that British rulers looked at India quite differently. Policies made\\nby them were also influenced by their ideological inclinations. During 19th cen-\\ntury, a series of reform movements swept across India. These movements tried\\nto address issues related to condition of women, caste rigidities, evils that had\\ncrept in religious beliefs of people, modernization of communities, educational\\nbackwardness etc. British policy makers also tried to popularize English educa-\\ntion in India. This could be the medium for the import of European culture and\\nmorality. This would eventually help them strengthen their control over this coun-\\ntry. During this period, both the English as well as the Indian language press\\nflourished. However, restrictions were imposed at different times to curtail the\\nfreedom of press. Social changes that occurred during the modern period helped\\nto prepare the country ultimately for a national liberation movement against the\\nBritish rule.\\nGLOSSARY\\nOrientalists\\n:\\nGroup of British Administrators who popularized\\nIndia’s glorious past.\\nWhig political philosophy :\\nExecutive, Legislative & Judiciary should be sepa-\\nrate organs of the government.\\nBengal Renaissance\\n:\\nHistorical rediscovery of Bengal’s glorious past &\\nmodernization of its language & literature.\\n40\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nSOCIAL CHANGES IN MODERN INDIA\\nCustom of Sati\\n:\\nPractice of immolation of wife in the Funeral pyre\\nof husband.\\nPolygamy\\n:\\nHaving more than one wife.\\nBrahmo Covenant\\n:\\nWritten by Debendranath Tagore, it is a statement\\nof the creed of the samaj having a list of duties &\\nobligation of its members.\\nSpiritual Hinduism\\n:\\nPropogating spirituality of Hinduism by Swami\\nVivekanand.\\nIdolatry\\n:\\nWorship of Idols.\\nMonotheism\\n:\\nBelieve in one God.\\nAnglo Vedic education\\n:\\nAryan ideology, vedic scriptures should be taught\\nwith English education.\\nShuddhi\\n:\\nMovement started by Arya Samaj, opposing con-\\nversion of Hindus to Islam and Christrianity   re-\\ncon version of recent converts to Hinduism.\\nGaurakshini Sabha\\n:\\nSociety for protection of cows.\\nFaraiz\\n:\\nMaintaining purity of Islam and objecting  to infil-\\ntration of non-islamic customs; Advocating pro-\\nfession of faith, namaz, roza, zakat and haj.\\nNatural science\\n:\\nAttempting to understand nature.\\nCharter Act\\n:\\nLegal document given by Queen of England thereby\\ngranting East India company exclusive privileges\\nof trading and related terms of references & was\\nrenewed from time to time.\\nVernacular Press\\n:\\nPrinting press  dealing with publishing of newspa-\\npers in local Indian languages.\\nTERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nHow were ideologies so important in shaping British policies in India?\\n2.\\nWhat was the contribution of the Orientalists in popularizing India’s past?\\n3.\\nWhat were the main social evils that afflicted the Hindu society in 19th century?\\n4.\\nHow important were the issues related to women in the reform movements of\\nthis period?\\n5.\\nWhat was Vivekananda’s opinion about the Eastern and the Western civilizations?\\n6.\\nWhat were the important issues raised by the Arya Samaj?\\n7.\\nIdentify the important reform movements in the Muslim community during 19th\\ncentury?

As we have learnt, over a period of 100 years,\\nstarting from 1750s to 1850s, the English East India company adopted various measures\\nto transform India into a colony Different policies followed by the British in India during\\nthis period were primarily in the interest of the British. A number of land revenue\\nexperiments were made which caused hardship to cultivators. Local administration\\nfailed to provide relief and natural justice to the rural poor. In this lesson we will learn\\nhow the peasantry and tribal people suffered under the colonial administration and why\\nthey resorted to revolts. With a brief narrative of important popular uprisings, we will\\nanalyze the nature and significance of these uprisings. The Revolt of 1857 has a major\\nsignificance because, for the first time, it brought together people having different eth-\\nnic, religious and class background in a unified movement against the British rule.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying the lesson, you will be able to:\\n•\\ndiscuss the background to the popular revolts which broke out till 1857;\\n•\\nexplain the nature and significance of these revolts,;\\n•\\nidentify the issues that led to the Revolt of 1857.and\\n•\\nanalyse the importance and significance of the Revolt of 1857.\\n19.1 CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO POPULAR REVOLT\\nWe have read in earlier lessons that the British rule in India had a number of changes in\\nsocio-economic life of the Indian people. The industrial Revolution  (we will learn more\\nabout it in  subsequent Lessons) made it necessary for England to look for raw materi-\\nals and markets in other countries. This necessity guided the policy of the colonial ruler\\nin India. Indian economy was geared to serve the interests of the British masters. Let\\nus recall some of the important changes in Indian economy during this period.\\n•\\nA new set of property relations was introduced and land was made saleable\\ncommodity.\\n•\\nPrivate ownership of land was recognized and a number of intermediaries came\\ninto existence in between the owner and cultivator of the land.\\n44\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nPOPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\n•\\nCommercial crops were encouraged in place of food crops to serve the British\\ncapitalists.\\n•\\nSpeculation and investment in land by merchants, bureaucrats and landlords led\\nto the growth of absentee landlordism.\\n•\\nGrowing burden of taxation made the cultivators an easy prey to the revenue\\ncollections, merchants and money lenders.\\n•\\nTransfer of wealth from India to England became a common feature.\\n•\\nLocal industries were suppressed   in order to make way for the British manu-\\nfactured goods.\\n•\\nTribals lost their traditional rights in land due to the land revenue policy of the\\nBritish government.\\nAll these changes dealt a serious blow to the rural society, particularly the cultivators\\nand tribals. For the peasant, the new changes in agrarian economy and social struc-\\nture meant more intensive and systematic exploitation.\\nTo recall it again, the colonial rulers were concerned only with the collection of rev-\\nenues in time which were fixed at high rates. Zamindars and others who were engaged\\nin collecting the revenue were least concerned about the paying capacity of the cultiva-\\ntors and forcefully collected the taxes. In meeting the increasing demand of taxes, the\\npeasants were compelled to sell their lands or they were caught in the trap of money\\nlenders. Justice could not be expected from the local administration because it was\\nunder the influence of the rich. Thus, under the colonial rule, the nexus of the official,\\nthe landlord and the money lender combined together to exploit the peasantry. Bengal\\nfamine of 1770, bear testimony to the devastating effect of the British policy over the\\nrural society. Alongwith the colonization of the economy, changes introduced by the\\nBritish in local administration and society created discontent and resentment among\\nlocal population. This discontent at various junctures took the form of rebellion.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 19.1\\n1.\\nHow did Indian peasantry met the increasing demand of taxes by Britishers?\\n2.\\nUnder the colonial rule nexus of which agencies was formed to exploit the\\npeasantry?\\n19.2 MAJOR UPRISINGS\\nBefore analyzing the nature and importance of early resistance to the British author-\\nity, it would be better for us to be introduced to some of the rebellions. From 1760s to\\nthe Revolt of 1857, there were a large number of rebellions spreading over different\\nparts of India. We will discuss these rebellions in two categories – the peasant upris-\\ning and the tribal uprisings.\\n(i)\\nPeasant Uprisings\\nGrowing burden of taxation, eviction from land and the Bengal famine led to the\\nimpoverishment of a large section of the peasantry. Many of these people being\\n45\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n POPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\nevicted from lands joined the bands of Sanyasis and Fakirs. Though they were\\nreligious mendicants they used to loot the grain stocks of the rich and the treasuries of\\nthe local government. The Sanyasis often distributed their wealth among the poor and\\nestablished their own government. However, they could not sustain their struggle for\\nlong in the face of strong repressive measures of the British rulers. Bankim Chanddra\\nChatterjee wrote a novel. Anand Math to imortalise the Sanyasi Rebellion.\\nPeasants of Rangpur and Dinajpur, two districts of Bengal, were aggrieved by the\\ntyranny of the revenue contractors. One such revenue contractor, Debi Singh, cre-\\nated a reign of terror by torturing the peasants in order to collect taxes. When the\\nBritish officials failed to protect the peasant, the peasants took the law in their own\\nhands. They attacked the local cutchheries and store houses of the contractors and\\ngovernment officials. The rebels formed their own government and stopped paying\\nrevenues to the Company agents. This rebellion was in 1783. The rebels were finally\\nforced to surrender before the Company officials.\\nIn South India, the situation was in no way different. The dispossessed landlords and\\ndisplaced cultivators raised the banner of revolt. The poligars of Tamilnadu, Malabar\\nand coastal Andhra revolted against the colonial rule in the late 18th and the early 19th\\ncentury. The revolt of the Mappilas of Malabar was most significant. The Mappilas\\nof Malabar were the descendants of the Arab settlers and converted Hindus. Major-\\nity of them were cultivating tenants, landless labourers, petty traders and fishermen.\\nThe British conquest of Malabar in the last decade of the 18th century, and the intro-\\nduction of the British land revenue administration in Malabar enraged the Mappilas.\\nOver assessment, illegal taxes, eviction from land and the change in land ownership\\nright caused growing discontentment among them. Thus, they rose in revolt against\\nthe British and the landlords. The religious leaders helped in strengthening the solidar-\\nity of Mappilas and in developing anti-British consciousness. These Mappilas were\\nsuppressed by the colonial rulers.\\nIn Northern India the Jats of Western U.P. and Haryana revolted in 1824. In Western\\nIndia Maharashtra was a common centre of uprising and Gujarat also witnessed the\\nrevolt of the Kolis. We can add more to the list of peasant rebellions. But let us look\\nat tribal uprisings.\\n(ii) Tribal Uprisings\\nThe establishment of colonial rule also affected the tribal people. Living outside the\\nboundary of the mainstream population the tribals lived in their own world being\\ngoverned by their own traditions and customs. The colonial government extended\\ntheir authority to the tribal lands and the tribals were subjected to various extortions.\\nThe tribals resented the entry of the colonial administration into their land. Take the\\nexample of the Bhils of Khandesh and the Kols of Singhbhum (Bihar) who enjoyed\\nindependent power under their chiefs. But the British occupation of their territories\\nand the entry of merchants, money-lenders and the British administration in these\\ntribal lands curbed the authority of the tribal chiefs. This led the tribal leaders to revolt\\nagainst the British rule and their target of attack were all the outsiders in the tribal\\nterritories. The insurrections were suppressed by the British.\\nSimilarly, the Santhals had been living in a large tract of land in the border of Bengal,\\nBihar and Orissa. Their livelihood depended upon the flora and fauna of the jungle.\\nWith the introduction of the British rule they were used to clear jungle lands and once\\nthey started cultivation on these lands, they were forcibly evicted. Thus, penetration\\n46\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nPOPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\nof landlords, merchants and money-lenders into their lands brought misery and op-\\npression for the simple living Santhals. The oppression forced the Santhals to take up\\narms, and they found their leaders in two brothers, Sidhu and Kanu. It was believed\\nthat Sidhu and Kanu had blessings from the gods to bring an end to their miseries.\\nThey decided to get hold of their lands and to set up their own government.

In 1857, we see for the\\nfirst time, peasant discontent along with protest of some other sections of society\\nagainst the British conquest, brought together various sections of the society in a\\nunified movement. The events of 1857 are regarded by many historians as early\\nmanifestation of nationalism.\\n47\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n POPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\nReasons for the Revolt\\nThere were specific grievances which actually precipitated the people’s discontent\\nagainst the British Raj and led to the Revolt of 1857. The Revolt broke out on 10th May\\nin Meerut, when Sepoys revolted and started marching towards Delhi to restore the last\\nMughal ruler, Bahadur Shah II, on the throne. The Revolt started by the Sepoys very\\nsoon spread to other sections of the society. Why did this happen? The British govern-\\nment by introducing changes in the land revenue system and in the administrative struc-\\nture made its rule unacceptable to the majority of the local population. Lord Dalhousie’s\\npolicy of annexation and the doctrine of lapse, particularly the annexation of Awadh and\\nother parts of north and central India, created widespread discontentment among the\\nlocal people in  this region . Land being the major economic resource the various land\\nrevenue settlements like the permanent settlement, Ryotwari settlement, Mahalwari\\nsettlement, etc. introduced by the British in India had significant repercussions on land\\ndistribution and distribution of power in local society.  The new land settlements were\\nbasically aimed at increasing the government’s revenue earnings and creating a class of\\nlocal agents who will stand in support of the British Raj. All these had disastrous conse-\\nquences on the cultivators and growing revenue demands even compelled Taluqdars\\nand other chiefs to sell their land. Money lending and auction of property further added\\nto the hardship of the peasantry. Artisans and handicrafts men were affected by the\\npromotion of British manufactured goods and neglect of indigenous industry.\\nBesides the economic grievances, at the social level there was a strong reaction in\\nthe local society against the British intervention in their age-old customs and tradi-\\ntions. Being guided by the philosophy of racial superiority a section of the British\\nofficials was engaged in modernizing and civilizing India. People were apprehensive\\nof the social legislation introduced by the British. Particularly the abolition of Sati and\\nthe widow remarriage act had a negative effect on the common people. These changes\\nwere viewed as intervention in the local tradition and culture. Added to this was the\\nfear of conversion to Christianity. All these alienated the people from the British Raj.\\nThe sepoys had their own reasons for resentment. The sepoys were unhappy for low\\npay and racial discrimination in matters of promotion, pension and terms of service.\\nSoldiers who were basically hailing from the peasant families were also unhappy with\\nthe new land settlements introduced by the British. It is true that the sepoys were\\nagitated for various reasons but an immediate provocation was their suspicion that they\\nwould be forced to renounce their cultural ethos of centuries old society. Just before the\\nRevolt of 1857, there was a rumor of bone dust in the Atta (flour) ration. The cartridges\\nof the Enfield rifles, which had to be bitten off before loading, were reportedly greased\\nwith pork and beef fat. This was perceived as an attack on the religious belief of the\\nsoldiers-both the Hindus and the Muslims. Sentiment of the sepoys was well reflected\\nin a proclamation issued at Delhi,- ‘It is well known that in these days all the English\\nhave entertained these evil designs-first, to destroy the religion of the whole  Hindustani\\nArmy and then to make the people by compulsion Christians. Therefore, we, solely on\\naccount of our religion, have combined with the people, and have not spared alive one\\ninfidel, and have re-established the Delhi dynasty on these terms.”\\nCourses of the Revolt\\nInitial disturbances started in March, 1857 when at Barrackpore, near Calcutta, Mangal\\nPandey, a sepoy, asked other sepoys to rise against the British military officers and he\\nkilled the British Adjutant, Mangal Pandey was later arrested and hanged to death.\\nAfter that in May, 1857 at Meerut the regiments of Indian sepoys shot down the\\n48\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nPOPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\nBritish officers, broke open the prisons, released their comrades and crossed over to\\nDelhi to appeal Bahadur Shah II, the pensioner Mughal emperor, to become their\\nleader. Rumour spread about the fall of the British rule and soon the rebellion spread\\nto other parts of north and central India. In Awadh, the sepoys proclaimed that sepoy\\nRaj had arrived. Dissatisfaction and disillusion against the British Raj brought many\\nlocal chiefs, peasants, artisans, civil servants, and religious medicants together in this\\nrevolt. In Awadh, the revolt spread to Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Benaras,\\nRohilkhand, Bundelkhand, Gwalior, Jhansi and Bihar. The revolt in these areas had\\nmassive response among the civil population. Some important leaders of the rebellion\\nwere Rani Laxmi Bai, Tantia Tope, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Nana Saheb, Kunwar\\nSingh of Arrah.\\nFig. 19.1 Bahadur shah (II) Zafar\\nLast Mughal Emperor freedom fighter\\nFig. 19.2 Rani of Jhansi\\nLaxmi Bai freedom fighter\\nFig. 19.4 Nana Sahib\\nFig. 19.3 Tantia Tope\\n49\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n POPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\nINTEXT QUESTION 19.3\\n1)\\nWhat were the grievances of Indian sepoys?\\n2)\\nName any five important leaders of rebellion of 1857?\\n19.5 NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVOLT\\nNature\\nHistorians are of different opinions regarding the nature of the Revolt of 1857. British\\nhistorians interpreted the revolt as a mutiny of the sepoys. Ignoring the grievances of\\nthe local people and their participation in the movement, the British historians felt that\\nthe rebellion was engineered by the sepoys, and some landholders and princes having\\nvested interest. Recent researches on 1857 however argue that self-interested mo-\\ntives did not have much significance before the combined opposition to the unpopular\\nBritish regime.\\nSome historians view the Revolt of 1857 as the first war of Indian independence Those\\nwho don’t agree with this interpretation argue that the rebel leaders did not make an\\nattempt to establish a new social order. They tried to restore the old Mughal rule by\\ninviting Bahadur Shah II. It is said that “Although Indian initiatives and priorities were so\\ncentral in the experience of change there was no national revolt in 1857. The discon-\\ntented were fractured in loyalty and intention, often looking back to a society and a\\npolicy which were no longer viable”. Thus, it was not revolution but just a restoration.\\nRecent studies on the Revolt of 1857, however, focus on the popular participation in\\nthe revolt. Besides the sepoys and Taluqdars, rural peasantry participated in large\\nnumbers in the revolt. In the case of Awadh, it has been shown that taluqdars and\\npeasants jointly launched the attack. Even in many places when taluqdars made peace\\nwith the British, peasants continued their movement. The sepoys had linkage with\\ntheir kinsmen in the villages and the revolt of the sepoys influenced the civilian popu-\\nlation to ventilate their grievances against the British rule. Thus the Revolt of 1857\\ntook the character of a popular uprising.\\nCauses of the Failure of the Revolt\\nIn spite of popular participation in the Revolt of 1857, the rebels were ultimately\\nforced to surrender before the British. Reasons for the failure of the rebels were:\\n•\\nthe rebels had limited supply of arms and ammunitions,\\n•\\nthere was a lack of communication and centralized leadership among the rebels,\\n•\\nthe British had sufficient resources and also better arms and equipments,\\n•\\nthe rebels did not have clear political agenda for future except their distrust on\\nthe foreign rule.\\n•\\nthe rebels, in spite of the popular character of the movement had failed to enlist\\nthe support of merchants, intelligentsia and many local princes that rather sup-\\nported the British.\\n50\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\n \\nPOPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\nSignificance of the Revolt\\nThe British though managed to suppress the revolt but realized the extent of people’s\\nresentment. The events of 1857 compelled the British to re–examine their policy\\ntowards India, after the revolt; therefore, they adopted a strategy to check the future\\nincidents of such a revolt. In order to win back the confidence of local princes, the\\nBritish made a declaration that they would no longer expand their existing territorial\\npossessions. Special awards were given to the loyal princes. In the recruitment of\\narmy, community, caste, tribal and regional loyalties were encouraged in order to\\ncheck the solidarity among soldiers. the British took recourse to the policy of ‘divide\\nand rule’ by tactfully utilizing caste, religious and regional identities of Indian people.\\nAnother important consequence of the Revolt of 1857 was the declaration of Royal\\nProclamation in 1858. By this proclamation India’s administration was taken over\\ndirectly by the British Crown abolishing East India Company’s rule.\\nFinally, though the rebels failed, their heroic struggle against the British Raj left a deep\\nimpression in people’s mind. The spirit of Indian nationalism which was at a formative\\nstage in the second half of the 19th century was greatly influenced by this Revolt.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 19.4\\n1)    When and how was East India company’s rule abolished?\\n2)\\nEnlist any three major causes of the failure of the Revolt?\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nIn this lesson we have learnt that the establishment of the British rule in India resulted in\\ntransformation of India into a colony of the British empire. Rural society was greatly\\naffected by this transformation. Being evicted from their lands, peasants became labourers\\non their own lands. Different form of taxes made their life more miserable.Whereas\\nthose who were engaged in small industries had to close their factories as a result of the\\nimport of British manufactured goods. All these changes and unresponsive attitude of\\nthe British administration compelled the peasantry to vent their grievances through\\nrebellions. Rebellions were not successful before the organized British armed forces.\\nHowever, these struggles paved the way for future challenge to the British Raj in India.\\nIn this regard, the Revolt of 1857 is unique in a sense that cutting across the  caste,\\ncommunity and class barriers, Indian people for the first time put up a unified challenge\\nto the British rule. Though the efforts of the rebels failed, the British government was\\npressurized to change their policy towards India.\\nTERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nExplain the nature of the rebellions earlier to the Revolt of 1857.\\n2.\\nDiscuss the causes of the Revolt of 1857.\\n51\\nMODULE - 3\\nModern India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n POPULAR RESISTANCE TO COMPANY RULE\\n3.\\nExplain the significance of the Revolt of 1857.\\nANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTIONS\\n19.1\\n1)\\nBy selling their land –holdings.\\n2)\\nOfficials of British Government, land lord and Money lender.\\n19.2\\n1)\\nBorder of Bengal, Bihar & Orissa.\\n2)\\nAnand-math written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.\\n19.3\\n1)\\nLow pay, social discrimination in promotion , pension & terms of service.\\n2)\\nRani Laxmi Bai, Tantia Tope, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Nana Saheb, Kunwar Singh\\nof Arrah.\\n19.4\\n1)\\nIn 1858 through a declaration of Royal Proclamation by the British crown.\\n2)\\nRefer section 19.5\\nHINTS TO TERMINAL EXERCISES\\n1.\\nRefer section 19.2, 19.3\\n2.\\nRefer section 19.4\\n3.\\nRefer section 19.5 para 4\\n52\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNATIONALISM\\n20\\nNotes\\nAll of us at some point in our lives, have to be loyal to our country. This loyalty to our\\ncountry may be generally understood as nationalism. A nationalist is a person who\\nloves his country. You may find statements of this kind in novels and poetry, speeches\\nand newspapers and also films.\\nHave you ever wondered when all this may have begun? What is the history of\\nnationalism? How old is this idea? Or. did people always love their country? Does the\\nworld ‘nationalism’ carry any other meaning apart from a feeling of loyalty for one’s\\ncountry? These are the questions that we shall try to answer in this lesson.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying the lesson,  you will be able to :\\n•\\ntrace the history of idea of nationalism;\\n•\\nexplain the reasons for the rise of nationalism in Europe;\\n•\\nrelate the growth of nationalism in India with the struggle against British colo-\\nnialism;\\n•\\ntrace the emergence of ideas of nationalism in the field of culture in India and\\n•\\nexplain how nationalism was expressed in economic terms\\n 20.1 NATIONALISM: ORIGIN & MEANING\\nIt may surprise you to learn that the history of this idea is not more than 200 years old.\\nNationalism, in the sense in which we use it today, did not exist in India before the\\n19th century. It may also surprise you to learn that the roots (origins) of this idea do\\nnot lie in the Indian history but in the history of Modern Europe. In fact it is possible\\nto talk of Indian nationalism as distinctly different from its European counterpart. In\\norder to know this difference it is important to have an idea of the circumstances\\nunder which nationalism took roots in Europe.\\nIn Europe the development of nationalism was the result of the fundamental changes\\nthat were taking place in society and economy around the 18lh century. The begin-\\nning of the industrial revolution produced goods and materials and created wealth at\\nan unprecedented (unprecedented means like never before) level. This led to the\\n53\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONALISM\\nneed for the creation of a unified and large market where these goods could be sold.\\nThe creation of a large market led to a political integration of villages, districts and\\nprovinces into a larger state. In this large and complex market different people were\\nrequired to perform different roles for which they needed to be trained in different\\nskills. But above all they needed to communicate with each other. This created the\\nneed for uniform educational centres with focus on one language. In the pre-modern\\ntimes majority of the people learnt language and other skills in their local environ-\\nments which differed from each other. But now, because of the new changes brought\\nabout by modern economy, a uniform system of training and schooling came into\\nbeing. Thus modern English language in England, French in France and German in\\nGermany became the dominant language in those countries.\\nUniformity in communication systems resulted in the creation of a ‘national culture’ and\\nreinforced national boundaries. People living within those boundaries began to associate\\nthemselves with it. Culturally they also began to perceive themselves as one people and\\nas members of one large community, i.e. Englishmen began to identify with each other\\nand with the geographical boundaries of England. Similarly it happened to German and\\nFrench people. This was the beginning of the idea of nationalism.\\nLet us understand this differently. Nationalism was the result of the emergence of\\nnations and nation states (large culturally homogenous territories with a uniform po-\\nlitical system within) in Europe. These nation states did not always exist. The early\\nsocieties, with simpler forms of human organizations and without an elaborate divi-\\nsion of labour, could easily manage their affairs without a state or a central authority\\nto enforce law and order. State, as a central authority, came into being after the\\nbeginning of organized agriculture. People generally found it difficult to manage their\\nlives without a central authority to regulate their lives. This need for a state became\\neven greater with the onset of industrialization and a modern world economy. An\\nelaborate system of communication and a uniform system of education with focus on\\none standardized language created conditions for cultural and political uniformity.\\nThus came into being modern nation states. These nation states, in order to sustain\\nand perpetuate themselves, needed the allegiance and loyalty of the people residing in\\ntheir territories. This was the beginning of nationalism. In other words, an identifica-\\ntion by a people or community with the boundary of the Nation, state and its high\\nculture gave rise to what we know as nationalism.\\nBut this was not how the idea of nationalism developed in India. The conditions in\\nIndia were very different at a time when the idea of nationalism was taking roots in\\nEurope. Industrialization occurred here at a very limited scale. When Europe was\\ngetting rapidly industrialized, India was still largely an agrarian economy. Different\\npeople spoke different languages. Though the feeling of patriotism, (patriotism: love\\nand a feeling of loyalty for one’s territory and culture like the one that existed among\\nthe Marathas for Marathwara or among the Rajputs for Rajputana) certainly existed\\nin India in pre-modern times. But nationalism as we understand it (unified system of\\nadministration, common language, a shared high culture and political integration) did\\nnot exist in India until about the middle of the 19th century.\\nNationalism in India developed primarily as a response to the British rule. British rule,\\nas yon know, came to the Indian soil in 1757 with battle of Plassey and gradually\\nestablished here by defeating the native rulers. As you are aware, the arrival of the\\nBritish as rulers was resented by many of the native rulers and people also. It was\\nclear that they all wanted to oppose and fight against the British presence in India.\\n54\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONALISM\\nBut initially they did not do it together or as one people. Different groups had their\\nspecific grievances against the British and therefore they fought for the redressal of\\ntheir specific grievances. For instance the native rulers did not want the British to\\ntake over their territories (as it happened to the rulers of Awadh and Jhansi in present\\nday U.P.). Similarly peasants, artisans and tribals suffered at the hands of the British\\nrulers and often stood up in revolt against them. (You have read about this in Module 3\\nof this Book). But merely the opposition to the British rule or a fight against them did not\\nbring about a feeling of nationalism in India. Although different sections of the popula-\\ntion got united because of common exploitation at the hands of the British, a feeling of\\nidentification with the entire country and its people did not come about. Even the great\\nrevolt of 1857, in which many sections of the population fought together (like native\\nrulers, soldiers, zamindars and peasants) did not produce a feeling of nationalism or an\\nall-India unity. The idea that the people of India, in spite of many differences among\\nthemselves, had many things in common amongst them had not, as yet, taken roots.\\nSimilarly the realization that the British rule was foreign and an alien rule which wanted\\nto subjugate the entire people and bring them under its control, had also not occurred.\\nThe essence of nationalism in India, or Indian nationalism, was the realization that all\\nthe Indian people had a common nationality and that it was in their collective interests\\nto resist the British rule. To put it simply, a combined opposition to British rule and a\\ndesire to achieve national unity lay at the heart of Indian nationalism.\\nThe objective conditions for the development of nationalism were indeed fulfilled by\\nthe arrival of the colonial rulers and their penetration into Indian society and economy.\\nHowever, these conditions in themselves, did not create an awareness of nationalism\\namong the people. The consciousness of the idea of nationalism took a long time to\\nmature and made its presence gradually in the fields of culture, economy and politics.\\nIn the following section we shall look at them separately.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 20.1\\nI.\\nRead the following statement and mark true or false:\\ni) The history of nationalism is as old as the history of mankind. (true/false)\\nii) The idea of nationalism has its origins in the history of modern Europe. (true/\\nfalse)\\niii) Nationalism was the result of the modern industrial economy. (true/false)\\niv) In India the realisation of nationalism had not come about until the middle of\\nthe 19th century. (true/false)\\nII.\\nMention two points which are crucial to the understanding of Indian nationalism.\\n20.2 CULTURE AND NATIONALISM\\nIt was in the field of culture that the ideas of nationalism was expressed first. This\\nhappened at two levels:\\n•\\nFirstly it happened in the form of questioning some of the elements of traditional\\nIndian culture and a desire to bring about reforms in it by removing some socially\\n55\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONALISM\\nundesirable feature of Indian culture like caste system, religious superstitions,\\npriesthood, discrimination against women etc.\\n•\\nSecondly, an attempt was also made by the Indians to oppose the British en-\\ncroachment in the Indian culture.\\nIt is important to remember that the colonial conquest did not just mean the replace-\\nment of one kind of rulers by another. Its effect penetrated deep down to the lives of the\\nordinary people. In a variety of ways, through the efforts of British rulers and their\\nagents, the culture of then colonial rulers began to spread among the Indian people.\\nThis spread of colonial culture and language produced two responses among the\\nIndian elites (elite: socially privileged people belonging to high culture and the upper\\nstrata of the society). Some of them began to compare the traditional Indian society\\nand culture with the one that existed in Modern England. They thus questioned\\nsome of the elements of the Indian culture. For instance social reformers like Raja\\nRammohan Roy and Ishwarachandra Vidyasagar worked hard for the eradication\\nof some of the social evils that were a part of the Indian society. In particular\\nRammohan Roy attacked the practice of Sati (burning of the widow along with the\\nhusband on his death) and Vidyasagar advocated remarriage of widows. Leaders\\nlike Jotiba Phule initiated anti-caste movements in Maharashtra. They also made\\nan appeal to the colonial rulers to intervene in the Indian society and bring about\\nreforms, although they did not believe that the European culture was superior to\\nIndian culture. They did. however, believe that the British rule represented a mod-\\nernizing force which could help in the development of the Indian society along\\nmodern and rational lines.\\nAt another level, however, the Indian leaders tried to ‘defend’ and protect Indian\\nculture against what they thought was an encroachment of the colonial culture into\\nthe lives of the Indian people. When attempts were made in the 1850s to impose a\\nEuropean dress and other practices on the Indian people, it was resisted by them.\\nInterestingly this was also true of those social reformers who admired the British rule\\nand hoped that the colonial rule would, through legislation and other means, introduce\\nmodernity in India. Thus Keshub Chandra Sen, a prominent 19th century reformer\\nand a leader of the Brahmo Samaj (formed by Rammohan Roy in 1828) did not like to\\nwear English dress or eat English food. Similarly Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar refused\\nto go to a function hosted by the Lt. Governor because he was required to wear\\nEuropean dress. In this approach cultural rights and practices of the people were\\nseen as very important and the colonial rule was defied on the ground that it was\\ntrying to impinge upon them.\\nThe two approaches mentioned above may seem to you different and also in conflict\\nwith each other. The former approach (of questioning the evils of the traditional\\nIndian culture) may look different from the later approach (of resisting any attempt\\non the part of the colonial rulers to either appropriate or try to change the local Indian\\ncultures). It may appear to you that the first approach invited British intervention in\\nthe Indian society whereas the second approach opposed it. But it is very important to\\nremember that, as components of Indian nationalism, both the approaches comple-\\nmented each other. The idea of cultural nationalism, as it developed in the 19th cen-\\ntury was based on a firm rejection of some of the negative features of the traditional\\nIndian culture by, or its integration into, the culture of the colonial rulers. In other\\nwords the 19th century social reformers wanted the Indian culture to become truly\\nmodern; but they did not want it to become totally western. In this sense they were\\n56\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONALISM\\nopposed to both the traditional culture but also to the modern colonial culture. This\\nwas the essence of cultural nationalism as practised in 19th century India.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 20.2\\n1.\\nAnswer the following questions:\\ni)\\nName the reformer who attacked the practice of Sati.\\nii) Which Indian reformer advocated widow remarriage?\\niii) Name the organisation founded by Rammohan Roy.\\n2.\\nMention two important features of cultural nationalism.\\n20.3 ECONOMIC NATIONALISM\\nYou have now understood what is meant by cultural nationalism and what was the\\nrelationship between culture and nationalism in India. Let us now try to understand\\neconomic nationalism. The origins of economic nationalism can be traced back to the\\nsecond half of the 19th century when Indian leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Mahadev\\nGovind Ranade and Romesh Chandra Dutt among others began realizing that the\\nBritish rule was economically exploiting India and that it was largely responsible for\\nkeeping India under extreme poverty. From this a whole generation of Indian leaders\\nlike Gopal Krishna Gokhle, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, G.V. Joshi and many others devel-\\noped a systematic and comprehensive economic critique of the British rule. Following\\nare some of the features of economic nationalism they propounded and preached\\nthrough their writings:\\nThey emphasized that the colonial rule was economically exploiting India in a variety\\nof ways. Initially this exploitation was confined to heavy taxation of the peasantry and\\nthe unequal trade with India. It was an unequal trade because the British East India\\nCompany (which was granted a monopoly of trade with India by the British Parlia-\\nment) bought Indian goods very cheap and sold British manufactured goods to India\\nat a very expensive rate. This resulted in India’s wealth going to England. It also\\ndestroyed the traditional handicraft industries of India. However, in the 19th century,\\nwhereas this form of economic exploitation continued, new and more complex forms\\nof exploitation came into being. Now the colonial rulers exploited India as a supplier\\nof raw material for their industries and a market where the goods produced in the\\nBritish industries could be sold. India was made to cultivate those raw materials\\n(like cotton or jute) which were required by British industries. The impact of this\\nwas that India’s wealth, which could have been utilized for India’s industrialization\\nand economic development, was utilized instead for Britain’s economic develop-\\nment. The Indian nationalist leaders learnt these vital facts and propagated them at\\nthe same time.\\n57\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONALISM\\n•\\nAs a part of their understanding about a steady economic exploitation of India,\\nthe nationalist leaders, Dadabhai Naoroji in particular, propounded the ‘drain theory.\\nNaoroji, in his famous book Poverty and the Un-British Rule in India written\\nin (1901 pub. 1988) argued that India’s economic resources were being system-\\natically siphoned off to England through trade, industrialization and high salaries\\nto British officials which were being paid by Indian money. According to their\\ncalculations this ‘drain’ amounted to one half of government revenues and more\\nthan one third of India’s total savings. It was thus that Britain’s enrichment and\\nIndia’s improvishment were taking place simultaneously.\\nThe early nationalist leaders thus argued that the British colonial rule, in a variety of\\nways, completely subordinated Indian economy to the economy of Great Britain. In\\ntheir view the direction of the Indian economy was being geared to suit the needs of\\nBritish economy. They demanded an end to the flow of Indian wealth to England and\\nthe industrialization of India with the help of Indian capital only, so that it would\\nbenefit India and Indian people. In order to achieve this, the nationalist leaders de-\\nmanded self-rule, or self-government or Swaraj for their country.\\nThe relevance of economic nationalism, as formulated by the nationalist leaders, was\\ntwo-fold:\\n•\\nFirstly, it demolished the notion, generally held by the educated people in the first\\nhalf of the 19th  century, that the British colonial government was a benevolent\\ngovernment and would ultimately lead to India’s economic development. Many\\npeople had believed that, if the colonial rule would continue for a long time, India\\nwould, in the end, become prosperous like Great Britain. The Indian nationalist\\nleaders were able to demonstrate that this was wrong thinking and that the Brit-\\nish colonial rule was actually harmful to the interests of the Indian people.\\n•\\nSecondly, economic nationalism laid the foundation for a powerful nationalist\\nagitation against the British colonial rule which started in the 20th century under\\nthe leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders. These leaders took the\\nideas of the ‘economic nationalism’ to the Indian people and thus mobilized them\\ninto the national movement. Once the masses of Indian people joined the national\\nmovement, it became impossible for the British colonial rule to remain in India.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 20.3\\n1.\\nAnswer the following questions:\\ni)\\nName some of the Indian leaders who argued that the British rule was\\nexploiting Indian economy.\\nii)\\nWhat is the Drain theory and who propounded it?\\niii) What is the importance of economic nationalism?\\n58\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONALISM\\niv) How was the idea of economic nationalism used by the leaders of the\\nnational movement in the 20th century?\\n2.\\nFill in the blanks:\\ni)\\nBritish East India Company carried on an \\n with India.\\nii)\\nDadabhai Naoroji wrote the book \\n.\\niii) The Actual drain from India to England amounted to \\n of India’s\\ntotal savings.\\niv) The colonial rulers exploited India as a source of \\n for their\\nindustries.\\n20.4 RELIGION AND NATIONALISM\\nApart from cultural nationalism and economic nationalism, there were other ways also\\nin which the idea of Indian nationalism was being expressed. There came into being, in\\nthe second half of the 19th century, a thinking on Indian nationalism which was based on\\nreligion. It was leaders like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Dayanand Saraswati (who\\nfounded Arya Samaj in 1875). Vivekanand. and Arbindo Ghosh who made Hindu reli-\\ngion and its ideas the motivating force behind Indian nationalism. They looked upon the\\nBritish presence in India as an attempt by the Western civilization to dominate the\\nIndian civilization. They were completely opposed to this domination.\\nThese leaders were convinced that although the British had succeeded in conquering\\nIndia, the Eastern civilization was superior to the Western one. Bankim Chandra\\nargued that although the British had conquered India with the help of military and\\ntechnological superiority, Indians should not start blindly following it. He argued about\\nthe uniqueness of the Indian society where the ideas of Western civilization could not\\nbe applied. These leaders understood the Western civilization to be based on the ideas\\nof individualism (rather than spirituality) and found them to be completely unsuitable\\nfor India. Vivekanand believed that the Western ideas had to be re-modelled accord-\\ning to the Indian situation. He said: “In Europe, political ideas form the national unity.\\nIn Asia religious ideas form the national unit.”\\nThese leaders derived their inspiration not from the Western texts and other sources\\nbut from the traditional Indian texts like Vedas, Upnishads and Gita. They criticized\\nthe British colonial rule mainly on the ground that it was trying to impose an inferior\\nmaterial system on India which was a land rich with spiritual resources.\\nThis understanding of nationalism based on religion had a political aspect also. Lead-\\ners like Bal Gangadhar Tilak wanted to take the idea of nationalism to the people.\\nThey knew that religion was a very important moral force in the Indian society.\\nHence they decided to use religion in the propagation of nationalist ideas. In order to\\nbe able to speak to people in their language, i.e. religious language, Tilak introduced\\nthe Ganapati festival in Maharashtra in 1893 to create a religious platform from where\\nnationalist idea could be preached and spread.\\nThis understanding of nationalism based on religion led to two different kinds of politi-\\ncal mobilizations in the 20th century. On the one hand, leaders like Mahatma Gandhi\\nwelcomed the use of religion for nationalist mobilization. But they did not confine this\\n59\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONALISM\\napproach only to Hindu religion. They used the symbols and language of Hinduism,\\nIslam and other religions too. Thus they tried to bring members of different religious\\ncommunities into the national movement and also promote unity among them.\\nThe second approach was more exclusivist in nature and was reflected in the activi-\\nties of organizations like Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League. Whereas the lead-\\ners of Hindu Mahasabha confined their activities only to Hindu, those of the Muslim\\nLeague appealed only to Muslims. They also did not develop any understanding of\\nIndian nationalism either by contributing to the unity of the Indian people or by engag-\\ning in persistent opposition to British colonial rule.\\nIn the end it is important for you to understand some aspects of the relationship\\nbetween various kinds of nationalisms that you have read in this Module. Although\\nthey may seem different from each other, they actually had many things in common.\\nThey were different from one another only to the extent that they followed different\\npaths so come to the same destination. They were also not opposed to each other in\\nany fundamental sense. They were all opposed to the British colonial rule but their\\nopposition was based on different grounds. The advocates of cultural nationalism\\nbelieved that the colonial rule had started encroaching into Indian culture which should\\nbe resisted. The profounders of economic nationalism argued that the colonial rule\\nwas economically exploiting India and was the main factor in keeping India back-\\nward. Similarly leaders like Bankim and Vivekanand opposed the British rule on the\\nground that it was tempering with the spiritual resources of India. All the three were\\nopposed to the colonial rule because of its impact on the Indian people. Their ideas\\nhelped in the building of a powerful anti-colonial Indian national movement in the 20th\\ncentury which finally defeated and overthrew the colonial rule from India.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 20.4\\n1.\\nAnswer the following questions:\\ni)\\nWho founded Arya Samaj?\\nii)\\nWhat, according to Indian leaders, were the central ideas of the western\\ncivilization?\\niii) Name the Indian leader who introduced Ganapati festival in order to reach\\nout to the people.\\n2.\\nRead the following statements and mark true or false:\\ni)\\nBankim Chandra felt that the ideas of western civilization could be applied to\\nIndia (true/false)\\nii)\\nLeaders like Dayanand and Vivekanand derived their inspiration from the\\nEuropean texts (true/false)\\niii) Economic nationalism, cultural nationalism and nationalism based on religion\\nfollowed different paths to arrive at the same end (true/false)\\n60\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONALISM\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nIn this lesson, the following points are worth mentioning:\\n•\\nThe idea of nationalism first took roots in Europe in the 19th century and was the\\nresult of rapid industrialization and the onset of modern industrial economy.\\n•\\nIndian nationalism was distinctly different from its European counterpart. In In-\\ndia the idea of nationalism emerged only around the second half of the 19lh\\ncentury.\\n•\\nThe idea of Indian nationalism was based on the twin idea of opposition to the\\nBritish colonial rule and a unity of the Indian people.\\n•\\nThe impact of the British rule was felt first in the realm of culture. It was argued\\nby the Indian leaders that an intrusion of colonial culture into Indian culture was\\nharmful and should be resisted.\\n•\\nThe early nationalist leaders pointed out the economically exploitative nature of\\nthe British colonial rule and thus created what came to be known as ‘economic\\nnationalism’\\n•\\nSimultaneously, many other leaders preached Indian nationalism which was based\\non religion and which was motivated by religious considerations.\\n•\\nThis development of Indian nationalism with many branches resulted, in the 20th\\ncentury, in the building of a powerful Indian national movement. This Indian\\nnational Movement was based on the 19th century ideas of Indian nationalism\\nand was backed up by massive mass participation. The active participation by\\nthe masses transformed Indian nationalism into a powerful irresistible force which\\nultimately forced the British colonial rule to withdraw from India.

Mr. A.O. Hume a retired English Indian Civil Service officer\\nplayed a significant role in its formation. Among its members were Pherozeshah Mehta,\\nBadruddin Tyabji, WC Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Anandamohan Bose and Romesh\\nChandra Dutt. This organisation was by no means the first such association of the Indian\\npeople. The English educated class in India was slowly becoming politically conscious and\\nseveral political associations were being formed between 1875 and 1885. Dwarkanath\\nGanguly of Calcutta, Ranade and GV Joshi of Poona, KT Telang of Bombay and G\\nSubramaniya Iyer, Viraraghavachari of Madras were already associated with regional\\npolitical associations. The names of their organizations were Indian Association, Poona\\nSarvajanik Sabha, Bombay Presidency Association, and Madras Mahajan Sabha, respec-\\ntively. The agenda of these associations was limited and far from the ideal of complete\\nindependence. These associations were raising their voice against policies of the colonial\\nregime that might be inimical to the interests of Indians. The primary issues of concern\\ntaken up by the early nationalists belonging to these associations were as follows:\\n63\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\n(a) cotton import duties to be made favourable for Indians\\n(b) Indianization of government services\\n(c) Opposition to Afghan policy of the British Government\\n(d) Opposition to Vernacular Press Act and control over the press\\nWhat made the Indian National Congress (INC) different from the other associations\\nwas its attempt to provide a common political platform for the people of India which\\nenabled it to claim that it represented the country. Although the British administrators\\nattempted to play down the significance of the INC, it did manage to reflect the\\naspirations of the people. Thus the most important and the foremost objective of this\\norganization was to create the consciousness among the people of belonging to a\\nsingle nation. The task was daunting because of the existence of diverse cultural,\\nlinguistic and religious traditions of the land. All the different forces had to be brought\\ntogether against the common adversary, the British imperialism.\\nAt first the founders of the INC had hoped to influence the colonial government in\\nmatters that affected the well–being of the country and specially its economic\\nupliftment. They expected that if the problems of’ the nation were brought to light\\nthrough proper propaganda, the colonial government would take steps to improve\\nmatters. Thus in the initial years through lectures, writings in newspapers the nation-\\nalists put forward the main problems of the nation and ways in which they could be\\nremedied. The most valuable contribution of the so called ‘moderates’ or the initial\\nmembers of the Congress was to formulate an economic critique. Firstly Dadabhai\\nNaoroji and thereafter other nationalists found that instead of bringing about an indus-\\ntrial revolution, which the Indian intelligentsia were expecting, the British rule was\\nmaking the nation poorer and was, destroying its indegenous handicraft production.\\nThis discovery led to some disillusionment among the early nationalists who had hoped\\nthat India would be modernized as a result of British rule. The other concerns of the\\nearly Congress were as follows:\\n(i)\\nThe reform of Supreme and Local Legislative Councils with greater powers for\\nIndian representatives\\n(ii) Indianization of the Civil Services with simultaneous examinations to be held in\\nEngland and India.\\n(iii) Changes in the forest laws that affected the Indian people\\n(iv) Organization of campaigns against indentured labour in Assam tea plantations\\nSlowly, there came to the fore other younger leaders who realised that colonial rule\\nwould bring no positive gains for India and her people and the end of colonial rule was\\nthe only way in which India can progress. Thus was born a new group of leaders who\\ncondemned the ‘moderates’ for their methods of appeal and petition. Aurobindo Ghosh,\\nAswinikumar Dutt, Lajpat Rai, BG Tilak,were the new breed of leaders who sought\\nto generate mass support for their goal of Swaraj and Swadeshi.\\n21.2 SWADESHI AND BOYCOTT: THE EXTREMIST POLITICS\\nThe phase between 1885–1905 is known as the period of the moderates. In 1905\\nLord Curzon, the then Governor general announced the partition of Bengal. The\\nprovince of Bengal at that time comprised of the present states of West Bengal, Bihar\\n64\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nand Jharkhand, Orissa and Assam. It also included the present country of Bangladesh, it\\nwas indeed a very large administrative unit. However the way the partition was done\\nclearly showed the divisive policies of the British. Firstly, it was on the lines of religion,\\nwhere the areas where Hindus were in a majority, were separated from Muslim majority\\nareas. Moreover the urban bases of the resurgent intelligentsia (English educated upper\\ncaste Indian), were separated from the mainly cultivating areas, (most significantly the\\njute producing areas), was also an attempt to reduce the significance of Calcutta where\\nthe intelligentia from all over Bengal met and inspired each other. There were widespread\\nprotests following this announcement. Initially the protest was on the lines of the ‘prayer\\nand petition’ tactics of the moderates whereby petitions and memoranda were addressed\\nto the colonial government, and speeches, public meetings and press campaigns were\\nheld. This was an attempt to influence the public opinion in India and in England. In spite\\nof these attempts the partition of Bengal was announced in July 1905.\\nAs soon as the final announcement was made Bengal broke out in protest. Protest\\nmeetings were held all over Bengal and most significantly not only in Calcutta but also\\nin the smaller towns in the interiors of Bengal e.g. Dinajpur, Pabna, Faridpur, Dacca,\\nBarisal etc. The decision to ‘boycott’ British goods was taken up for the first time in\\none of these meetings. Formal proclamation of the Swadeshi movement was made\\non August 7 1905 with the passing of the ‘Boycott’ resolution in a meeting at the\\nCalcutta townhall which brought about the unification of the hitherto dispersed lead-\\nership. On the day the partition was put into effect i.e. October 16, 1905, a hartal was\\ncalled in Calcutta and a day of mourning was declared. People fasted and no fire was\\nlit in the cooking hearth. People paraded the streets singing Bande Mataram. The\\npeople of Bengal tied rakhis on each others’ wrist as a symbol of solidarity.\\nThis peculiar form of mass protest of ‘swadeshi and boycott’ attained popularity\\namong the new members of the Congress who were more impatient than the moder-\\nates to see a positive response to their efforts. Lokmanya Tilak took the message of\\nswadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods to Bombay and Pune; Ajit Singh and\\nLajpat Rai to Punjab and other parts of Northan India: Syed Haider Raza to Delhi and\\nChidambaram Pillai to Madras presidency which was also motivated by Bipin Chandra\\nPal’s extensive lecture tours. The INC formally took up the swadeshi call in its Benaras\\nsession of 1905 presided over by GK Gokhale. Although the Congress supported the\\nswadeshi movement in Bengal it did not envisage the further intensification of the\\nmovement throughout India or the extention of the cause to total independence. The\\nextremist leadership of Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghosh\\netc wanted just that. This extremist pressure promoted Dada Bhai Naoroji in his\\npresidential address in Calcutta session of the Congress to say that the ultimate goal\\nof the INC was ‘self-government or swaraj’.\\nThe contribution of the swadeshi movement was the initiation of new forms of pro-\\ntest. Some of these terms of protest anticipated many of the methods adopted by\\nMahatma Gandhi during his satyagraha. These new forms of protest were mass\\nmeetings, processions, boycott of foreign goods (later extended to boycott of govern-\\nment schools, colleges, courts, titles and government services), and organization of\\nstrikes, burning of foreign goods in public, picketing of shops selling foreign goods.\\nAttempts were made to achieve mass mobilization and ‘samitis’ were formed which\\npenetrated deep into the interiors of Bengal spreading the swadeshi message.\\nFor the first time in the national movement there was the use of traditional and popu-\\nlar festivals to reach the people. The Ganapati and Shivaji festivals in Maharashtra\\n65\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nwere employed by Tilak to draw the masses to the movement and educate them\\nabout it. In Bengal the use of swadeshi songs was made to inspire the people. The\\npopular theatre form known as jatra was also used to spread nationalist feeling. This\\nmovement was accompanied by a great out-burst of cultural activities.\\nFinally the colonial government was compelled to withdraw the partition in the form in\\nwhich they had envisaged it. However they did try to decrease the importance of\\nCalcutta and hence the intellectuals of Bengal by shifting the capital to Delhi in 1911.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 21.1\\n1.\\nWhen was Indian National Congress was formed?

The Extremists were in favour of boycott of the assembly elections to be\\nconducted under the constitutional reforms introduced by the colonial government.\\nThe moderates wanted to participate in the electoral process however limited. Finally\\nthe rift resulted in the split in the Congress in the Surat session of the Congress, 1907.\\nThe extremist leaders continued to mobilise the masses while the Congress tried to\\ninfluence the government policies. The Morely- Minto reforms of 1909 were a blow\\nto the aspirations of the moderates. The swadeshi movement had lost its momentum.\\nHowever the revolutionary message of the movement inspired another more indi-\\nvidualistic kind of protest i.e. the revolutionary movement.\\nThe revolutionary goal was the end of British rule through extreme self sacrifice.\\nTheir methods were to assassinate unpopular colonial officials who were responsible\\nfor giving shape to the repressive acts of the Government. The colonial response to\\nthe mass movements was always two fold. On the one hand it gave concessions to\\nthe leaders by undertaking constitutional reforms and inviting them to participate in\\nthe limited elections, on the other hand there was large scale repression mainly through\\narrest of key leaders. The extremist leadership spent several years in jails. Their\\nbeing in and out of jails resulted in the revolutionary movement largely being under-\\nground, operated by secret organizations. These organizations had their genesis in the\\nsamitis of the Swadeshi days.\\nIn 1908 Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw a bomb at a carriage that was\\noccupied, they believed, by Kingsford, the unpopular judge of Muzzafarpur. However\\n66\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nthey killed two English ladies in his place. Chaki shot himself and Khudiram was\\nhanged. The revolutionaries who mainly belonged to the Anushilan and Yugantar\\nsamitis, also undertook swadeshi dacoities to raise funds for their movement. The\\nrevolutionary movement was not confined to Bengal. Rasbehari Bose and\\nSachindranath Sanyal setup a revolutionary network spanning Punjab, Uttar Pradesh\\nand Delhi areas. In 1912 these two revolutionaries made an unsuccessful attempt on\\nthe life of the Viceroy Lord Hardinge in Delhi.\\nThe Revolutionary movement had also started slowly spreading beyond the shores of\\nIndia. Shyamji Krishnaverma had started in 1905 a centre for Indian students in\\nLondon called India House. In 1907 this organization was taken over by a revolution-\\nary group under VD Sarvarkar. Madanlal Dhingra of this organization assassinated\\nthe India Office bureaucrat Curzon-Wyllie in London in 1909. In Europe (Paris and\\nGeneva) Madame Cama a Parsi revolutionary established contacts with French social-\\nists and brought out the revolutionary journal Bande Mataram. In Berlin, Virendranath\\nChattopadhay and others operated since 1909. In Britain and Europe the revolutionary\\ngroups were fairly isolated. However the movement found something of a mass base in\\nthe United States of America, specially in the states of British Columbia and those along\\nthe Pacific coast. These states had a population of 15000 Indians mainly of the Sikh\\ncommunity who were facing considerable amount of racial discrimination in spite of\\nbeing successful traders and workers. Amongst this population began the Ghadr Move-\\nment in 1913 in the city of San Francisco. The movement was founded by Sohan Singh\\nBhakna and Har Dayal was one of its most prominent leaders.\\nThe First World War began in 1914, and the revolutionaries saw in this a very good\\nopportunity in pushing through their agenda of complete independence. Britain was\\nbusy in preparation for war and troops from India were sent out for this purpose.\\nEnemy nations like Germany would be only too willing to give funds for revolutionary\\nactivities to weaken Britain. Britains aggression on Turkey brought the support of pan\\nIslamists as Turkey was the seat of the Khalifa revered by Muslims the world over.\\nBarkatulla was one of the important Muslim revolutionary leaders who joined the\\nGhadr movement. At Deoband, in an Islamic centre of learning in Uttar Pradesh a\\ngroup of learned men, or Ulema, also preached the revolutionary message which had\\na large following among Muslims.\\nMeanwhile swadeshi dacoities and the assassination of Englishmen continued and\\nthere was a marked increase in revolutionary activity at this time. The Bengal revo-\\nlutionary outfits united under Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and planned large scale\\ndisruption of rail communications and seizure of arms. They were successful when a\\nlarge arm and ammunition of the Rhoda firms in Calcutta came into their hands.\\nHowever their long-term plans were cut short due to the capture of Bhagha Jatin by\\nthe police in Balasore, Orissa. Ras Behari Bose and Sachin Sanyal plan was also a\\npart of the Bengal revolutionary movement. This group established contact with the\\nGhadr movement. The Ghadrites had started coming back to India in large numbers.\\nThe Komagata Maru incident further inflamed passions. The ship Komagata Maru\\ncarrying Sikh and Muslim passengers to Canada was turned away by the Canadian\\ngovernment and reached Calcutta in September 1914. The passengers clashed with\\nthe police and 22 people were killed.\\nThe Ghadr movement and the revolutionary plans were unsuccessful because the\\nBritish government came down with a heavy hand on them. Most of the Ghadrites\\nwho returned were immediately arrested. The attempt to incite mutiny in several\\n67\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\narmy units was foiled and Ras Behari Bose fled to Japan and Sachin Sanyal was\\ntransported for life. The revolutionaries and specially the Ghadrites were the pioneers\\nof organizing revolution among the army units and among peasants.\\n21.4 HOME RULE MOVEMENT\\nBalgangadhar Tilak who served a jail sentence from 1908-1914, returned to the Con-\\ngress which had now become more open to him after the disappointment of the\\nCouncil elections under the Morley Minto reforms. By 1914-15 the swadeshi move-\\nment, the efforts at council entry and influencing the administration from within and\\nthe revolutionary movement had all spent themselves. It was a time for a new thrust\\nto the national movement that was to come from the Home Rule Movement of Annie\\nBesant and Tilak. Tilak worked from within the Congress to set up a kind of agitational\\nnetwork through his Home Rule League, which he set up in April 1916. At about the\\nsame time Theosophist leader Annie Besant rose to great prominence and proposed to\\nstart agitation for a great measure of self-government for the Indians. Besant also\\nproposed to set up a Home Rule League in the country modeled on the Irish Home Rule\\nmovement to spread awareness. Besant’s League was set up in September 1916.\\nTilak’s League was active in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Besant’s League, with its\\nheadquarters in Adyar, Madras had more of an all India following. The activities of\\nthe Home Rule Leagues were to organize discussions and reading rooms in cities, to\\ncirculate pamphlets and conduct lecture tours to sway public opinion. The Home Rule\\nmovement never spelled out the goal of complete independence, however they did\\nfocus on the oppression of colonial policy through its opposition to government policy,\\ne.g., forest laws, liquor laws etc. A new generation of leaders of the nationalist move-\\nment was formed during this time and the focus of the movement shifted from Bengal\\nand Punjab to Maharashtra and the South. Many moderate Congressmen also joined\\nthe Home Rule movement. However, the Home Rule movement came to an abrupt\\nend after 1918.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 21.2\\n1.\\nWho founded Ghadr Movement  in the city of San Franscisco?\\n2.\\nWhat is Komagata Maru incident?\\n3.\\nWho brought out the revolutionary journal?\\n4.\\nAnnie Besant and Tilak started which movement?\\n21.5 THE GANDHIAN MASS MOVEMENT: THE INITIAL YEARS\\nThe British Government introduced the next set of constitutional reforms in 1919\\n(The Montague-Chelmsford Reforms). Although these reforms claimed to have brought\\n68\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nforth local self-government and considerable autonomy to Indians, they kept the real\\npowers firmly in British hands. The system of dyarchy as introduced by these\\nreforms gave greater representation to Indians and greater control of local expendi-\\nture. However the elected legislature had no control over the executive.\\nThe post war years (the First World War ended in 1918) saw growing unrest in the\\ncountry as the impact of the War on the economy of India became more apparent. War\\nled to rise in the prices, scarcity, unemployment etc added to which there was an influenza\\nepidemic. Wartime necessities had given rise to a class of entrepreneurs in India and a\\nlarge working class was also created that was becoming more organized. This working\\nclass was restive and a potential force in the nationalist movement. Part of the capitalist\\nclass was loyal to the colonial state because it helped them control the labour force.\\nHowever there were also some among them who were supportive of the national move-\\nment. They were opposed to the economic policies of the colonial government and realised\\nthat the end result of British policy would be to the detriment of Indian industry.\\nThe arrival of MK Gandhi in these turbulent times marked yet another phase in the\\nnationalist movement. Gandhi who arrived in India in 1915, used his own methods to\\nharness these forces that existed in India in the post war years. His style was to\\naddress specific issues and laws and organize a peaceful resistance and violation of\\nthe laws with the help of disciplined cadres. The significance of Gandhi’s movement\\nwas that he brought the focus upon specific issues. Gandhi first achieved success in\\nthree movements in Champaran Kheda and Ahmedabad respectively. The first two\\nwere peasant movements and the last was a strike of the millworkers of Ahmedabad.\\nThe peasantry at Champaran was agitating against the European planters who forced\\nthem to cultivate indigo. There was a history of peasant unrest against planters in\\nChamparan. Raj Kumar Shukla, one of the peasant leaders, went all the way to Lucknow\\nto invite Gandhi to see their plight. Gandhi instituted an open enquiry into the matter in\\n1917. The Champaran movement also got wider publicity with the government trying to\\nrestrict Gandhi’s entry into that area and later letting him go there on threat of satyagraha.\\nThe outcome of the Champaran movement was that the tinkathia system, under which\\nthe farmers had to cultivate indigo in 3/20th of their holdings, was abolished.\\nThe next movement Gandhi associated himself with was the agitation of the mill\\nworkers at Ahmedabad. The dispute between the workers and the owners had oc-\\ncurred due to the withdrawal of the ‘plague bonus’. The owners withdrew the bonus\\nafter the epidemic had passed and the workers opposed the withdrawal because of\\nthe rising prices after the War. Gandhi persuaded the workers and owners to negoti-\\nate before a tribunal. The owners suddenly withdrew from the arbitration on the\\npretext of a strike called by some workers and declared that they were ready to give\\nonly 20% bonus and threatened dismissal to those workers who did not comply. Gandhi\\nwas greatly offended by this breach of agreement and declared that after proper\\nstudy of the production cost, profits and the cost of living the conclusion was drawn\\nthat the workers were justified in asking for 35% increase in wages. Ambalal Sarabhai,\\none of the mill owners was a close friend of Gandhi and had given a liberal donation\\nto his ashram at Sabarmati, and his sister Anasuya Ben was one of his greatest\\nsupporters in the Ahmedabad mill workers struggle. During the last stages of this\\nstruggle Gandhi for the first time used the fast as a means of protest. Gandhi ob-\\nserved that the workers were slowly losing their morale so he decided to go on a fast.\\n69\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nHe declared that if the strike was to lead to starvation then he should be the first to\\nonce more and the matter was resolved with the workers getting the 35% raise.\\nThe third movement was that of the Kheda peasants whose crops had failed and they\\nwere unable to get a remission of land revenue from the government. First, enquiries\\nwere made into the situation, as was the norm of all Gandhian movements. Crop\\nyields were studied and it was confirmed that it had been one third of the normal yield\\nwhich made the peasants eligible for a total remission of revenue. Gandhi advised the\\npeasants to withhold the revenue. Vallabhbhai Patel and Indulal Yajnik helped Gandhi\\nin the Kheda district by organising his tour of the villages and urging the peasants to\\nstand firm. The government unleashed severe repression seizing cattle, household\\ngoods and even attaching standing crops. After putting up a brave struggle however\\nthey began to suffer in the face of repression. At that very movement Gandhi learnt\\nthat the Government was contemplating a compromise by directing that the revenue\\nbe recovered from only those who could pay it. Gandhi had asked the well off peas-\\nants also to withhold payment so that the poorer peasantry may not surrender. On\\nlearning of the Government directions, thus, Gandhi withdrew the movement.\\nThe outcome of the Champaran, Ahmedabad and Kheda movements, that occurred\\nbetween 1916–1917, was that Gandhi was able to experiment with his method of\\nnon-violent satyagraha. The movements helped him to test the waters so to say. He\\ncultivated his own core group of followers who would assist him and follow his orders\\nin the forthcoming movements. In these movements Gandhiji showed his special tal-\\nent for reconciling apparently opposed interests e.g. mill owners and workers, keep-\\ning his friendship with one and at the same time gaining the trust of the other.\\nThe next significant movement under Gandhi’s leadership was the Rowlatt satyagraha. In\\nFebruary 1919, two bills that would severely curb the civil liberty of Indians were sought to\\nbe made into laws. The government wanted to pass these laws so that they may be able\\nto control the rising tide of discontent among the population. The laws would provide for\\narbitrary detention and punishment without trial etc. In fact one of the bills was passed in\\nthe Council and made into law inspite of protests from the elected Indian members. This\\nkind of restriction on the liberty of individuals might have been acceptable during the war\\nyears. But the end of the war had given rise to the hopes of further constitutional reform\\nand a greater control of Indians over their own affairs if not self–government.\\nHaving seen the futility of the protests from the Council members and others, Gandhi\\nlaunched ‘Satyagraha’. A ‘Satyagraha Sabha’ was formed that attracted many mem-\\nbers. It was decided that a nationwide ‘hartal’ or strike would be observed to protest\\nagainst the Act and fasting and prayers will be conducted. There would also be civil\\ndisobedience of certain laws. The Rowlatt Satyagraha was the first nationwide pro-\\ntest in India under the guidance of Gandhi. The people of India showed a great and\\nswelling resentment against British rule and the hartals became violent. 6th April 1919\\nwas decided as the day of hartal, however due to some confusion it was observed on\\n30th March in Delhi and led to fighting in the streets. Punjab had faced very severe\\nwartime oppression due to forcible recruitment and widespread disease and other\\nhardships. Amritsar and Lahore were centres of this movement. Gandhi tried to go to\\nPunjab and get the movement back on the track of non-violent styagraha. However\\nGandhi was prevented from entering the Punjab by the British government and was\\ndeported to Bombay. Bombay and Ahmedabad were also experiencing disturbances\\nat that time and Gandhi tried to control the movement there.\\n70\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nEvents in Punjab came to a head when two local leaders were arrested and the local\\ntown hall and post office were attacked as a result. During the nationalist movement\\na popular form of protest was to attack the symbols of British government, telegraph\\nwires were cut, post offices attacked, and Europeans including women were at-\\ntacked. The army was called and meetings and assemblies were banned.\\nOn the 13th of April 1919 a Baisakhi day gathering at Jalianwalla Bagh in Amritsar\\ninvited the wrath of General Dyer who was made in charge of the city. The General,\\nangered that the ban on public meetings was being flouted attacked the unarmed and\\nhelpless gathering and had his men fire at the crowd for ten minutes and only stopped\\nwhen his ammunition was spent. No prior warning was issued to the people before\\nfiring started and there was no escape other than the narrow pathway where Dyer’s\\nmen stood with their guns as the Jallianwalla Bagh was enclosed by walls on all sides.\\nThis incident left 379 dead according to a conservative government estimate. This\\nbrutal incident was followed by even more brutal repression.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 21.3\\n1.\\nGandhiji experimented with which movement on his method of non-violent\\nsatyagraha during 1916–1917?\\n2.\\nWhen was Rowlatt satyagraha launched?\\n3.\\nWhat is the importance of Baisakhi day of 1919 in National Movement?\\n21.6 NON–VIOLENT NON–COOPERATION\\nMartial law was imposed in Punjab after the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. Inhuman\\ntreatment was meted out to Indians e.g. men were made to crawl on their bellies in\\nthe bylane where a European woman had been attacked. Although the Rowlatt\\nsatyagraha had been withdrawn, the feeling of resentment toward British rule grew\\neven more bitter. The Montague Chelmsford reforms of 1919 frustrated the hopes of\\nthose who still had any faith in the colonial government’s intention for bringing about\\nreforms enabling Indians to participate in the government.\\nAt this juncture a large group of enlightened Muslim leaders emerged and they had a\\nspecial reason for discontent with the British government. The Muslims were of-\\nfended by the insensitive treatment of Turkey after the First World War. Muslims all\\nover the world regarded the Caliph of Turkey as their spiritual leader and they had\\nbeen assured that the Caliph will be treated leniently after the defeat of Turkey and its\\nallies in the War. However in the post war treaty with Turkey the powers of the\\nCaliph were severely curtailed.\\nMatters came to a head when the Hunter Committee that was appointed by the\\ngovernment to look into the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy submitted its report. In this\\nreport they upheld the action of General Dyer and all other kinds of repression. This\\nreport enraged all the Indian leaders and the moment was ripe for the next movement\\nof protest. It was at this time that Gandhi contemplated a non-violent non-cooperation\\nmovement. The non-cooperation movement was an expression of the growing\\n71\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nresentment of all classes of the Indian people against oppressive British rule. Gandhi\\ntook up three specific points on which the movement was initiated: (a) the Khilafat\\nwrong, (b) the Punjab wrong, and (c) Swaraj.\\nThe call for non-cooperation first came from the All India Khilafat Conference at\\nDelhi on 22-23rd November 1919 at the initiative of the Ali brothers (Mohammad and\\nShaukat). At the Allahabad meeting of the Khilafat Conference, a programme of\\nfour-stage non-cooperation was announced- boycott of titles, of the civil services, of\\nthe police and army and finally non-payment of taxes. Thereafter, Gandhi began to\\nurge the members of the Congress to give theirs support to the movement. In the\\nhistorical Calcutta special session in September, 1920 the Congress adopted a\\nprogramme of giving up of titles, a boycott of schools, courts and Councils and also\\nboycott of foreign goods. This boycott would be side by side with the establishment of\\nnational schools and courts to resolve matters without taking recourse to the judicial\\nsystem of the government and the adoption of khadi. In the Nagpur Congress of\\nDecember 1920, veteran Congress leader of Bengal Chittaranjan Das lent his sup-\\nport to the movement. Although the movement was formally initiated on 1st August\\n1920, the Congress leaders support gave a new impetus to it and from January 1921,\\nit gained great strength. Within a month a large number of students left government\\naided schools and colleges and joined national institutions that had been started in\\ndifferent parts of the country.\\nSeveral well-established lawyers like CR Das, Motilal Nehru, Saifuddin Kichhlu,\\nVallabhbhai Patel, C Rajagopalachari, Asaf Ali etc, gave up their lucrative practices.\\nThis sacrifice inspired the people. Boycott of foreign goods, picketing of shops selling\\nforeign cloth were other forms of protest. Charkhas began to be distributed and\\nhandspun cloth became popular among nationalists. Nationalist newspapers held ad-\\nvertisements inviting people to participate in bonfires of foreign goods. The value of\\ncloth exports fell to a great extent. Along with cloth shops there was also for the first\\ntime picketing of liquor shops.\\nTo the alarm of the British government Muhammad Ali in July 1921 appealed to all\\nMuslims in the British Indian army and declared that they must consider it morally\\nwrong to be a part of the British army and that they should not continue in it.\\nHe was arrested at once. This call was taken up by the Congress and Gandhi. A\\nmanifesto was issued calling all men (civilian and soldier) to sever all links with the\\nBritish Indian army. In the midst of this the Prince of Wales visited India in November\\n1921, and was greeted by a hartal in Bombay where he landed and also in the rest of the\\ncountry. Gandhi addressed a huge meeting on the day of the Prince of Wales’ arrival\\nand anti- British feeling was so strong that a riot situation occurred when the people\\ndispersing from the meeting came across the others who had gone for the welcome\\nprocession of the Prince.  Gandhi had to go on a four day fast to reduce tension.\\nThe non-cooperation movement was gaining strength progressively. In Midnapur district\\nof Bengal a movement was organized against Union Board taxes and a no-tax movement\\nwas also organized in Andhra Pradesh. The refusal to pay taxes under the Gandhian\\nscheme was to be resorted to in the very last and most radical stage of the movement. In\\nthe Awadh region of UP the kisan movement was gaining ground through the kisan sabhas\\nwhich were becoming more organized and a great threat to British rule.\\nThe stand of the colonial government was also becoming more rigid. The fall in cloth\\nexports, the show of resentment from the students, lawyers, government officials,\\n72\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nworkers, peasants, plantation workers and attempts to influence the army finally led\\nto the adoption of repressive measures against the movement. Public meetings and\\nassemblies were banned, newspapers repressed, and midnight raids were conducted\\nat Congress and Khilafat offices. The Congress under Gandhi’s guidance was begin-\\nning to chalk out a programme of civil disobedience at Bardoli. This move was how-\\never cut short by a violent incident at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur district of UP. A\\nKhilafat and Congress procession on being confronted by some policemen turned\\nviolent and attacked the police. The policemen tried to take shelter in the police\\nstation, however the enraged mob set fire to it and hacked to death those policemen\\nwho came out to escape the fire. Twenty-two policemen were killed. This incident\\noccurred on the 5th of February and on the 12th Gandhi withdrew the non-cooperation\\nmovement. This withdrawal proved that at this stage Gandhi did not want to lead a\\nmovement which he could not control and it also proved that the nationalists would\\nheed Gandhi’s call, for though there were many who differed from him, no one thought\\nof defying his call for withdrawal.\\nWithin the Congress party there was a difference of opinion between those who\\nwanted to enter the legislative councils through the soon to be held elections; and\\nthose who wanted to undertake Gandhian constructive work in villages and preparing\\nfor the next step of the struggle. Rajagopalachari, Ansari and others advocated rural\\nconstructive work while Motilal Nehru, Vithalbhai Patel and Hakim Ajmal Khan wanted\\nto enter the councils and disrupt the business of the government through creating a\\ndeadlock in the system. Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel supported the former\\nview while CR Das adhered to the latter view. Das and Motilal Nehru set up a\\nSwaraj Party in 1923 to contest the elections. The ‘No-Changers’ as the group of\\nGandhians was called gained support with the release of Gandhi from jail in 1924.\\nHowever the Congressmen could not be prevented from standing in the elections\\nthough they were made to acknowledge the importance of constructive work.\\nThe Congress candidates did win several seats in the elections held in November\\n1924 in the Central Provinces and in Bengal. Initial efforts at disrupting the processes\\nof the Councils began, but whatever regulation the members did not allow to be\\npassed was pushed through by the special powers assigned to the Governor exposing\\nthe limitations of the system of dyarchy. Soon the elected members began to lose\\ndirection and were slowly beginning to be absorbed in the system. In Bengal, CR Das\\nsuddenly passed away causing a leadership problem there. At this stage of the nation-\\nalist movement amidst political uncertainties and a lull in the activities under the ‘main-\\nstream’ Congress movement arose a far more radical group of activists in the second\\nphase of the revolutionary movement.\\n21.7 THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT: REORGANIZATION\\nAND REORIENTATION\\nThe spontaneous upsurge of the non-cooperation movement released the great force\\nof India’s youth that were determined to wrest freedom. The youth of the country\\nhad responded eagerly to the call of Gandhi and had participated in the non-coopera-\\ntion movement. The sudden withdrawal of the movement was a blow to their aspira-\\ntions. The secret samitis of the first phase of the revolutionary movement began to be\\nrevived in Punjab and in Bengal.\\nThe Anushilan Samiti in Bengal was associated with Subhas Bose and the Yugantar\\nSamiti with the JM Sengupta group. There was considerable amount of political\\n73\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nrivalry between these two groups. Some smaller revolutionary groups began to be\\nformed at about this time for example the one under Surya Sen of Chittagong that\\ndeveloped along much more radical lines. The most striking revolutionary action of\\nthe time was the murder of an Englishman, Day, by Gopinath Saha in January 1924.\\nSaha had planned to kill Tegarb the police Commissioner of Calcutta and killed Day\\nby mistake. This incident resulted in the arrest of many nationalists.\\nAnother centre of revolutionary ferment was northern India where Sachin Sanyal and\\nJogesh Chatterji and others formed the Hindustan Republican Association in the United\\nProvinces and started raising funds through dacoities. The most renowned of which\\nwas the Kakori train robbery in August 1925 that resulted in the arrest of several\\nmembers of the organization. This organization also established links with a group of\\nyoung men in the Punjab under the dynamic and brilliant student leader Bhagat Singh.\\nThe Punjab group was deeply influenced by socialist ideology. Hence the organization\\nwas renamed Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). The aim of the\\nrevolutionaries was complete independence and they had a vision of how the State\\nshould be after the achievement of the same. They envisaged a mass struggle of the\\npeople and for this purpose they tried to mobilise students workers and peasants.\\n21.8 BYCOTT OF SIMON COMMISSION\\nAmidst this reformulation and resurgence of the revolutionary movement and the subdued\\nstate of the mainstream movement was announced the Simon Commission to formulate\\nfurther constitutional reforms for India. The all-white commission did not include any\\nIndian and thus it was clear that the forthcoming reforms, if any, would not fulfill the\\naspirations of the Indian people. Dyarchy had already shown itself to be a great farce with\\nall the key decision-making powers still firmly in the hands of the colonial government.\\nThe announcement of the all-white Simon Commission sparked off widespread discon-\\ntent and fanned the fires of the nationalist movement. All shades of political opinion in\\nIndia unanimously condemned the Commission as not a single Indian was included in it.\\nThe Indian response to the Commission was a unanimous resolution by leaders of\\nevery shade of opinion to boycott it. All the important cities and towns observed a\\nhartal on the day that the members of the Commission landed in India (3rd February\\n1928). There were mass rallies and processions and black flag demonstrations against\\nthe Commission. ‘Go Back Simon’ was imprinted on banners, placards and even\\nkites. Black flags were waved at the Commission wherever it went. Needless to say\\npolice repression was harsh and merciless and processions were attacked and not\\neven the most prominent leaders were spared. The most insensitive attack was on\\nLala Lajpat Rai, one of the outstanding leaders of the extremist era in Lahore. This,\\nnow elderly, leader was hit by lathis and he succumbed to this attack a few days later.\\nThe death of Lajpat Rai created tremendous resentment against the British rule all\\nover. During this period an important development within the Congress was the\\nadoption of Purna Swaraj or complete independence as its objective. Complete\\nindependence meant a total severance from the British connection.\\nAs a result of the adoption of the Purna Swaraj pledge there was a rise of great\\nexpectations in the country and similar independence pledges were taken all over the\\ncountry on 26th January 1930. There was unrest brewing in the country proof of\\nwhich was a railway strike led by the communists based in the Bombay-Nagpur\\nregion. The Congress led movement started getting ready for a movement of civil\\ndisobedience that would include non-payment of taxes in its extreme form. Congress\\n74\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nlegislators were instructed to resign preparation for the next round of struggle. Gandhi\\nhowever began with issuing an ultimatum to the\\nViceroy Irwin on 31st January, which did not mention anything about complete\\nindependence, or Purna Swaraj. The Eleven points were rather a set of specific\\ndemands that the nation was making from the colonial government. One of the\\ndemands was for the abolition of the salt tax and the government monopoly of\\nmanufacture of salt. The demands also included fifty per cent reduction in land\\nrevenue, protection of textiles, fifty per cent cuts in army expences and civil\\nservice salaries etc.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 21.4\\n1.\\nOn which specific points non cooperation movement was initiated?\\n2.\\nWhen and by whom Swaraj Party was founded?\\n3.\\nGive full form to HSRA.\\n21.9 CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT\\nAs there was no response to the eleven point ultimatum, the movement of civil dis-\\nobedience was launched based on the issue of salt. Salt was an item of basic neces-\\nsity for all and any taxation on it would affect the poorest of the poor, thus salt\\nbecame the symbol of the deprivation and oppression of the Indian people. Both the\\nmasses and the nationalist leaders began to identify with the issue. On the 12th of\\nMarch 1930, Gandhi accompanied by 72 of his followers at the Sabarmati ashram\\nbegan a march upto the sea at Dandi. The dramatic Dandi march drew a great\\nresponse from people. Crowds of people greeted and followed the marchers all along\\nthe way. Villagers spun yarn on charkhas, as Gandhi went past, to show their solidar-\\nity to him. On 6th April, Gandhi reached the sea at Dandi and picked up a handful of\\nsalt at the sea side launching a country-wide civil disobedience movement by break-\\ning the salt law. All over India people began the illegal manufacture of salt. Through\\ncareful planning and large scale recruitment of volunteers the movement spread from\\none part of the country to another, from Madras to Maharashtra and from Bengal and\\nAssam to Karachi. In the farthest north there was a massive demonstration at\\nPeshawar, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and his followers the Khudai Khidmatgars or\\nthe Red Shirts had been active here doing constructive work for some years and the\\nresponse was tremendous. The city came under the control of the masses for atleast\\na week and the soldiers of the Garhwali regiment refused to fire at the unarmed\\ncrowds. Nehru’s arrest on 14th April was followed by public protests in Madras,\\nCalcutta and Karachi. The colonial government was in a dilemma as they had not\\nexpected the salt satyagraha to create such an upheaval. Finally it decided to act and\\nGandhi was also arrested in May that only resulted in further intensification of the\\nmovement. The most important aspect of the civil disobedience movement was the\\nwidespread participation the youth, particularly students and also women. Women\\npicketed liquor shops and shops that sold foreign goods.\\n75\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nThe government started to issue ordinances curbing the civil liberties of the people\\nand civil disobedience organizations began to be banned in the provinces. The Con-\\ngress Working Committee was banned in June and the Congress President Motilal\\nNehru was arrested. Local Congress Committees were also banned by August. A\\nnumber of local issues also become a part of the civil disobedience movement.\\nIn the midst of government repression and the intensification of the- movement the\\nSimon Commission report was published and there was no suggestion that India might\\nbe given dominion status. This resulted in turning the most moderate of Indian political\\nopinion against the British. The Viceroy then extended the invitation for a Round\\nTable Conference and reiterated the intention of discussing the award of Dominion\\nStatus. Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru were taken to Gandhiji to discuss the offer.\\nHowever no headway could be made between the Congress and the government.\\nThe First Round Table Conference was held in London in November 1930 between\\nthe Indian leaders and the British but the Congress was not represented. However it\\nwas evident that in any negotiation involving the British and Indian leaders on an\\nequal footing the absence of the Congress would fail to bring any results. The next\\nConference was scheduled to be held in the next year. The Government released\\nGandhiji on 25th January 1931, all other members of the Congress Working Commit-\\ntee were also released unconditionally. The Congress was asked to deliberate on the\\nViceroy’s offer to participate in the next Round Table Conference.\\nAfter a lot of deliberation and discussions with the delegates of the First Round Table\\nConference the Congress assigned Gandhi the task of negotiating with the Viceroy.\\nThe discussions between Gandhi and Irwin went on for a fortnight. Finally on 5th\\nMarch 1931 the Gandhi-lrwin Pact was signed. The terms of the Pact were as fol-\\nlows–\\n(a) all people arrested for non-violent protest were to be released immediately\\n(b) fines that had not been collected were to be remitted\\n(c) confiscated land that had not been sold off yet was to be returned to peasants\\n(d) government employees who had resigned were to be treated leniently\\n(e) villages along the coast were to be given the right to make salt for consumption\\n(f) the right to peaceful and non–aggressive picketing was granted\\nOn its part the Congress agreed to withdraw the civil disobedience movement and\\nalso agreed to participate in the next Round Table Conference. Many among the\\nnationalist leaders perceived this agreement as a temporary truce. However many\\nwere not convinced of the necessity of this settlement. This gave rise to the renewed\\nactivities of the revolutionary secret societies and the more radical communist\\nmovements. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were executed at this time as the\\ncommunist movement spread throughout the country.\\nThe Congress in the Karachi session in March 1931 while reiterating the goal of Purna\\nSwaraj, also in the same breath endorsed the Delhi Pact between Gandhi and Irwin.\\nAlthough the Delhi Pact had made no mention of independence, the Congress at Karachi\\nwas preparing for the framing of India’s Constitution and it adopted resolutions on\\nFundamental Rights and a National Economic policy. This resolution was one of the\\nlandmarks of our constitutional history, where the civil liberties of free speech, free\\npress and freedom of association was worked out. Neutrality in religious matters, equality\\n76\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nbefore law, universal adult franchise, free and compulsory primary education and many\\nother provisions anticipated Constitutional provisions of free India.\\nGandhi set off to attend the second Round Table Conference in August 1931. Mean-\\nwhile the British Government’s stand was hardening in Britain and in India. Irwin was\\nreplaced by Willingdon and the favourable attitude of the Home Government had also\\nchanged. As a result not only did Gandhi gain nothing from the discussions at the\\nRound Table but on his return in December 1931 he found that new Viceroy did not\\nwish to meet him. It was as if the colonial government was regretting that they had\\nput the Congress at an equal footing with themselves by making an agreement with\\nthem. The government had also arrested Jawaharlal Nehru and had repressed the\\nMap 21.1 Indian National Movement: major events sites\\nIndian National\\nMovement: major\\nevents sites\\n77\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nmovement of the Khudai Khidmatgars in the North West Frontier Province by arrest-\\ning their leader Abdul Ghaffar Khan.\\nUnder these circumstances the Congress decided to resume the civil disobedience\\nmovement on the eve of which Gandhi had requested to meet the Viceroy to negoti-\\nate peace and the Viceroy refused. The colonial Government thereafter launched a\\nsevere offensive the first step of which was to arrest Gandhi in early January and a\\ntotal curtailment of the civil liberties of the people. This was followed by the govern-\\nment getting the right to appropriate property and detain the people. Armed with this\\npower the Government put all the prominent leaders of the Congress behind bars.\\nThis was followed by a massive reaction by the people. Thus mass demonstrations,\\npicketing of liquor shops and those selling foreign goods, ‘unlawful’ gatherings etc\\noccurred in a large scale which was followed by severe repression by a Government\\nthat was in no mood to come to an understanding with the nationalists. Jails were\\nfilled, the Congress was banned, Gandhian ashrams were occupied by the police.\\nProcessions were beaten up and scattered, people who refused to pay taxes were\\nbeaten and jailed and their properties attached. The people of the country with most\\nof the leaders in jails and on their own initiative with ruthless rep from the government\\nmanaged to sustain this civil disobedience for more than two years. Finally in April\\nGandhi withdrew the movement. This movement exemplified the moral strength of\\nthe common people or India and the stronghold of Gandhi as a national leader. Even\\nat this stage the leaders arid the people alike, in spite of difference in opinion, obeyed\\nhis decisions regarding the continuance of a movement.\\n21.10 INTENSIFICATION OF RADICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY\\n           MOVEMENTS AND RISE OF THE LEFT\\nThe years between 1930 and 1934 was also marked by an unprecedented explosion\\nof acts of revolutionary terrorism with its focus in Bengal and Punjab. A total of 92\\nincidents were reported in 1931 itself that included 9 murders. Exemplary among\\nthem was the Chittagong Armory Raid. In Chittagong a group of revolutionaries\\nunder Surya Sen captured the local armoury, issued an Independence Proclamation in\\nthe name of Indian Republican Army and put up a brave fight with the British in the\\nhills of the countryside for several days. The number of terrorist cases kept rising in\\nspite of severe repression by the colonial administration. The HSRA had also become\\nvery active in the Punjab with 26 incidents reported in 1930 alone.\\nThe freedom struggle was never confined to the single path of Gandhian satyagraha.\\nIt contained the very violent and extremist revolutionary movement, it also comprised\\nof the socialist ideology that came to India after the Russian Revolution, it would also\\ninclude a military offensive. These different strands of the movement were by no\\nmeans isolated. Most of the revolutionaries had participated in the Gandhian\\nnon-cooperation movement. In fact the Chittagong armoury was siezed amidst cries\\nof ‘Gandhi raj has come!’ Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh’s revolutionary\\ngroups adopted Socialism as did sections of the Congress under Jawaharlal Nehru\\nand Subhas Bose.\\nSocialism combined the freedom struggle with a clear cut agenda of social equality\\nthrough organized mass movements that helped to mobilise the working class. The\\ninitiative of working out the ideology of the communist movement in India was taken\\nup by eminent men like MN Roy who interpreted Marxism and the ideas of Lenin to\\n78\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nfit the Indian context. Seven Indians including Roy founded the Communist Party of\\nIndia at Tashkent in October 1920. Slowly the idea of Communism found favour\\namong many Indian intellectuals and even members of the Congress.\\nSubhas Chandra Bose was a unique personality influenced by a wide variety of ideolo-\\ngies and epitomized the spirit of the nationalist movement from non-cooperation through\\ngiving up of government posts, to the revolutionary extreme, upto the ideas of socialist\\nthought and finally choosing the courageous option of military offensive. Bose straddle\\nall these different strategies and proved that there was in essence no basic conflict\\nbetween the different visions of freedom at work within the nationalist movement.\\n21.11 CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE CONGRESS\\n           PARTICIPATION IN LEGISLATURES\\nIn 1935 was passed the Government of India Act that extended some concessions to\\nthe nationalist movement by introducing more autonomy to the elected members in\\nthe legislatures of the provinces. This Act also extended the voting rights to a greater\\npercentage of the Indian People.\\nThe British after introducing the 1935 Act announced the holding of elections to the\\nprovincial legislatures in early 1937. After the resolution of the dilemma within the\\nCongress, it took part in the electoral process and did very well. The Congress had\\nabsolute majorities in five out of the eleven provinces. This win encouraged the na-\\ntionalist movement with students, peasants and the working class. They all made their\\npresence felt and soon there were movements among these classes even in the Princely\\nStates that were outside the full control of the colonial State.\\n21.12 TOWARDS FREEDOM\\nCongress governments in different provinces remained in office for over two years and\\nundertook various measures in the interest of various sections of the people. Reduction\\nin rent for the peasantry, release of political prisoners and the lifting of restriction on the\\npress were some of the steps taken by the Congress governments. But above all it\\nindicated that the Indian people were capable to governing themselves.\\nTowards the end of 1939 all the Congress governments resigned. The second world war\\nbroke out in 1938 and the Viceroy unilaterally declared that India, as a British colony was\\na party to the war on the British side. As a marks of protest against this decision, the\\nCongress high command instructed all the Congress governments to resign.\\nWith the resignation of the Congress ministers, an important phase in the national\\nmovement came to an end. As a result of the non-cooperation and civil disobedience\\nmovement, the national movement had reached out to new areas and groups. This led\\nto an erosion of the British control from the minds and hearts of the people. The\\neffective running of the government by the congress in the proving undermind the\\nBritish control further.\\nThe second world war created a new crisis for the British. The War created a new\\ndemand for various commodities like clothes and food for the soldiers. These de-\\nmands could only be met through extractions from the society. This added to general\\nresentment against the British and weakened their support base further. To take an\\nexample, as a part of the requirement for the war, large quantities of food stuffs had\\nto carried out of Bengal. This resulted in a severe famine in Bengal and over three\\nmillion people died due to starvation. Thus the situation created by the second world\\n79\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\nwar created tremendous hardships for the people. It also created an unprecedented\\ncrisis for the British rule in India.\\nIn these circumstances a constantly declining support base of the British, Mahatma\\nGandhi decided to launch a final offensive against the British rule. Thus began the\\nfamous Quit India movement in August 1942. In this movement no demands were\\nmade from the British. They were simply asked to quit India. The British retaliated to\\nGandhi’s call to ‘Quit India’ by arresting him and all the members of congress work-\\ning committee. The news of the arrest of Congress leader angered the people further\\nwho came out on the streets and attacked  the British government which way they\\ncould. In the absence of their leaders people became their own leaders and attacked,\\nlooted and destroyed government property. The government dealt with the movement\\nwith severe brutality and many people were killed in police firing.\\nIn the end of British government was able to suppress the movement only with the\\nhelp of large scale killings and arrests. According to official figures, the number of\\npeople arrested by the end of 1943 was well over 91,000. Although the movement\\nhad been suppressed, it became very clear to the British government that they would\\nnot be able to hold on to India for long. The British themselves had realized it. Uptill\\nnow they had ruled the country with the help of a support system that they had built in\\nIndia since the 19th century. This support system had been eroded by the national\\nmovement, through a series of struggles. Without the help of various sections of\\nIndians (peasants, workers, middle classes, rich people, police, army among others) it\\nwas not possible for the British to rule India.\\nOnce the British realized this they began to make preparations for a gradual and\\npeaceful withdrawal from India. From 1944–45 onward, they released all the Con-\\ngress leaders and initiated a process of negotiations for a transfer of power from\\nBritish to Indian hands.\\nAnd so it was that India became free in August 1947. The attainment of freedom was\\na matter of great joy for Indian people. Indian people had won their battle against\\nmighty British imperialism. But it was not an absolute victory. Along with the freedom\\nof India came the partition of the land in two nation states-India and Pakistan. The\\nBritish government had always tried to prevent a unity of the Indian people. They had\\nnever agreed that all the Indian people were one with common interests. And so,\\nwhen they left India they decided to divide the country on the basis of religion. The\\nPartition of India was also accompanied by communal violence at a very large scale.\\nThe year 1947 is a very important phase in the history of India. It was a year of\\ntriumph of Indian people as they achieved their freedom from foreign rule. But it was\\nalso the year of a great tragedy for the unity of Indian people as the country was\\npartitioned into two separate nation-states.\\n  INTEXT QUESTIONS 21.5\\n1.\\nFrom where Dandi March was started?\\n2.\\nIn how many provinces Congress got absolute majorities during 1937 election?\\n80\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 4\\nContemporary India\\nNotes\\n \\nINDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT\\n3.\\nHow many people were arrested in Quit India Movement?\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nFollowing points are worth mentioning in this lesson:\\n•\\nIndian National Movement was not the name of one single event, but a whole\\nseries of political events, spread over many decades.\\n•\\nAnti-imperialism and national unity were two themes that were common to all\\nthe events and connected them with  one another.\\n•\\nThe early phase of the national movement was dominated by moderate leaders.\\nThese leaders put forward a series of demands before the colonial  rules.

China and India were\\nthen, as today, the most populous countries. Yet in 1900 Asia contained a smaller\\nportion of the world’s population than it does today. Most of the people all over the\\nworld were settled agriculturalists in 1900, which cultivated crops and animals and\\nlived in villages. In many parts of the world people existed as nomads, grazing herds\\nof animals, and many were tribal hunter-gatherers, although they formed a smaller\\nnumber in 1900 than a few hundred years earlier.\\nA steadily growing section of the world’s population lived in cities. Cities had existed\\nsince ancient times in many parts of the world, but they were limited in size and\\npopulation. However capitalist industrialization led to urbanization and faster growth\\nof population in cities. By 1900 Europe has a larger concentration of cities than any\\n84\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\nother region in the world: more than 100 cities had a population of at least 1, 00,000\\npeople, and there were six European cities with about 10, 00,000 inhabitants. Europe\\nand America had the largest cities, whereas in Asia and Africa large expanses of\\nterritory contained few cities and many stagnated and declined compared to hundreds\\nof years earlier. Most of the large cities outside of Europe in 1900 were only 100 or\\n200 years old-like Sydney and Chicago-and were inhabited mostly by people of Euro-\\npean origin. Some, like Calcutta in Bengal, grew under British rule.\\nMap 22.1(a) Urbanisation of Early 20th Century Euprope\\n85\\nMODULE - 1\\nAncient India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\nIn general human populations of Asia, Africa and South America in 1900 were 75–95%\\nrural, or living in villages and dependent on agriculture. Industrializing Europe, or\\nAmericas and Australia where people of European origin had settled, either already\\nhad or were close to having 50% urban population, i.e., living in towns and cities.\\nMap 22.1(b) Urbanisation of Early 20th Century Euprope\\n86\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\n22.2 INDUSTRIALISATION AND SOCIAL CLASSES\\nThe process of industrialization began in Western Europe after about 1700 with bringing\\ntogether of large number of labourers near areas of energy and resources to produce\\nmetals, and to operate machines that turned out finished products at a fast pace. By\\n1900 when big amounts of money began to be required for industry to operate on a\\nbig scale, we see the growth of capitalist industrialization. Capitalism derives from\\nthe word capital, meaning accumulated wealth and property, and those people who\\nhave capital are called capitalists. Capitalists were directly engaged in industrial\\nproduction, trading, administration and banking. By 1900 most of Europe, America\\nand Australia had undergone capitalist industrialisation.\\nThe wealth and property of capitalists came either from trade and commerce or from\\nexpropriating the property of small owners. On the other hand were people-men,\\nwomen and children-who worked in factories and who did not have any property and\\nwere dependent for their livelihood on their labour for which they got wages. Be-\\ntween them was a large majority which even in 1900 was not property less wage\\nearners, but which could not be called wealthy. Many were members of the salaried\\nmiddle classes: teachers, doctors, engineers, clerks, and in other services.\\nMost people by then also believed that the existence of such classes is normal and\\nwould continue to remain so, and that the majority of people would accept these\\ninequalities as their situation improved. They saw that the transfer of wealth from\\ncolonies would allow some benefits to go to the working people as well in the Euro-\\npean countries. This did happen to some extent by 1900, and most people lived\\nbetter than their grandparents had. But there were also difficult periods of\\nunemployment.\\nBy 1900 Asian and African cities like Bombay Shanghai and Dakar also contained\\nlarge numbers of businessmen, shopkeepers and other sections of middle classes, as\\nwell as industrial wage labourers. But population here was greatly outnumbered by\\nlandlords, peasants and agricultural labourers in the surrounding villages.\\nIt is important to keep in mind a few other facts about capitalist societies in 1900.\\nMuch of the raw materials and markets for European economies came from the\\ncolonies, and this relationship was also one of inequality: it was not an equal\\ntrading relationship. Within European societies landlords were no longer the\\ndominant class.\\n22.3 URBANISM AND KNOWLEDGE\\nAnother characteristic of industrialization was that production and sharing of knowledge in\\nsociety became more closely connected than before with urban life. Cities and towns\\nwere not only concentrations of industrial wage labourers, they also had growing numbers\\nof people engaged in jobs requiring education and literacy: clerks, managers, teachers,\\ngovernment officials etc. Soon it began to be recognized that even industrial workers with\\nliteracy and numeracy contributed to greater efficiency. Newspapers and magazines con-\\ntributed to it. Daily production of newspapers in 1900 exceeded one million copies in cities\\nlike London, Paris, Berlin and New York.\\nBy 1900 most industrial societies required that both boys and girls receive basic edu-\\ncation, at least up to the age of thirteen or fourteen. School teaching became one of\\n87\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\nthe modern professions in which women participated in large numbers. There arose a\\nknowledge and cultural gap between urban and rural people. As a whole, adult lit-\\neracy in some western societies by 1900 was between 60% and 90%, while it was\\nmuch less in non-western societies.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 22.1\\n 1.

Most produc-\\ntion in the non-industrial world in 1900 was driven by human and animal power. Even\\non American farms plows and mechanical harvesters were drawn by horses, as were\\ncarts, carriages and buses in the towns.\\nIndustrial societies required new energy sources to run their factories, light their homes\\nand offices, and power modern means of transport such as railway engines and\\nautomobiles. Thus Britain, France and Germany in 1900 were largely coal powered\\nsocieties, while Italy had begun to use hydro-electricity. US was relying increasingly on\\npetroleum fuels. By 1915 it was clear that cars would replace horses in transportation.\\nThese countries began to realize that their economic and political strength depended\\non sources of energy, and they began to exploit resources in their colonies. For ex-\\nample, the British were engaged in oil in Assam and Burma; the Dutch were doing the\\nsame in Sumatra and the Americans in Mexico. These factors determined their for-\\neign policies.\\n22.5 COLONIALISM, ECONOMIC PATTERNS, AND SOCIAL\\nRELATIONS\\nMost industrialized nations of the western world in 1900 directly ruled, or controlled\\neconomically, territories far beyond their own boundaries. Britain ruled over most of\\n88\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\nwhile Holland ruled over the entire area that is now Indonesia. France, Britain, Ger-\\nmany, Italy, Portugal and Belgium had colonies in Africa, Japan, China.\\nThese colonial rulers tried to prevent Asians and Africans from acquiring advanced\\ntechnologies, and carefully controlled railways and telegraph networks in their colonies.\\nThey also came down heavily on aspirations for freedom. They replaced the earlier\\nlanguages of administration with their own. They also initiated some educational poli-\\ncies with the aim of assimilating some sections of colonial society with the foreign rule.\\nThey also prepared some sections of them for manning the colonial administration at\\nlower levels. They practiced policies of divide and rule, restricted development of mod-\\nern economic activity and used education for purpose of creating a social gulf between\\nthose educated in the colonial languages and those in the local languages.\\nThe impact of colonialism and capitalist penetration altered social relations in the\\ncolonies. They altered the pattern of agriculture to shift its priorities towards the cash\\ncrops they might trade in. This pattern of production for export was greatly expanded\\nduring the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For example, Indian peasants\\nproduced opium that British entrepreneurs exported to China. Indian merchants too\\nhad a hand in this. In other words both production and trade were geared to the\\ninterests of the ruling power. As a result larger number of people around the world\\ncame to produce things that they did not themselves consume, while they consumed\\nthings produced elsewhere by others.\\nSuch commercial patterns created interdependence but also dependancies because\\nof the hold of the ruling powers. Peasants in many areas lost food sufficiency, with\\nthe result that although the total world production of food was higher than ever before\\nin history, the late nineteenth century famines killed millions of people.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 22.2\\n1.\\nWhich countries in 1900 were shifting towards use of fossil fuels?\\n2.\\nWhere were such fuel supplies located in 1900?\\n3.\\nDid international trade benefit the colonies of the great powers in 1900?\\n4.\\nWhile the total supply of food in the world grew rapidly during the last part of the\\nnineteenth century, many people lost food security. Why?\\n5.\\nHow was language use and access to education related to colonial rule?\\n22.6 IDEOLOGIES AND POLITICAL MOBILIZATION IN THE\\nDEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED WORLDS\\nThe world of 1900 saw a tremendous growth of ideas and competing ideologies or\\nvarious sets of political ideas about life and organization of societies. This was to a\\n89\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\nlarge extent the result of economic and social transformations connected with indus-\\ntrialization. The debates became widespread and different ideologies began to have\\nmass following and organizations due to the rise of print culture and other means of\\ncommunication. By 1900 print media in western countries and in many colonies as\\nwell were providing information (and advertising products and services) to large num-\\nbers of people, but also shaping their political views.\\nLiberalism\\nLiberalism as a set of ideas began to emerge more than three hundred years ago when\\nnobles and people of substantial property (sometimes joined by poorer people) struggled\\nto regulate or limit the powers of the rulers. Liberals believed that individuals have some\\n‘natural rights’ including the right to resist oppression, accumulate property, freedom of\\nreligion, right to express their opinions freely and so on. They believed that governments\\nand rulers must be made to respect these rights. They thought formulation of public laws\\nand constitutions were the best method of creating and enforcing these rights. These laws\\nand constitutions were the best safeguard against arbitrary exercise of power by rulers\\nand government machinery. They also objected to state authorities dictating the religious\\nbeliefs of their people through national churches, as religion was a private matter. With\\ngrowth of popular movements liberalism was forced to acknowledge the extension of\\npolitical and citizenship rights to all members of society and not just the propertied classes.\\nThese included rights to form organizations and participate in elections.\\nLiberalism is also connected with certain economic ideas. Liberals saw people as\\neconomic agents, as producers and consumers of goods and services. They saw\\nthese as important aspects of their personalities and self expression of individuals.\\nBut to them it was not the labourer but the profit seeking merchants, shopkeepers and\\nmanufacturers who were the heroes. Adam Smith, one of the major spokespersons\\nof economic liberalism, argued that such people, if allowed to pursue their own self\\ninterest would contribute to common good. Economic activity if left to its own creates\\nit own set of supply and demand and this leads to fairness in society. They argued for\\nfree trade. So for economy the best government is that which governs least and\\nleaves everything to the market operations.\\nBy 1900 many liberals began to think that governments should intervene in a minimal\\nfashion by introducing some welfare measures for the poorer sections of society—like\\neducation and health. But their basic ideas remain till today. They represented mainly the\\ninterests of propertied people. Liberals drew their main support from professional and\\neducated people who were dissatisfied with traditional and arbitrary arrangements which\\nensured privileges on basis of birth (i. e., noble lineage), and of the business and industrial\\ncapitalists. They also won support of many working people who liked their arguments\\nabout constitutions and individual rights, but did not understand that they were not at all\\nkeen on economic equality or economic rights of the working people.\\nConservatism\\nConservatives came mainly from land owning and other sections of society who did not\\nlike the abolition of privileges and restrictions which benefited them. They were from\\nland–owning classes, or merchants and traders who enjoyed state protection and mo-\\nnopolies which were lost due to free trade policies. For them the whole idea of natural\\nrights was disruptive because it destroyed the old traditional order in society, in which\\neach section of society already had its place. To them social order and stability were more\\nimportant than equality. They felt that while all may be equal before God, it was not\\n90\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\ndesirable that it should be so in the real world as well. They saw the old social order as the\\nbest defense against the chaos of the modern world which was causing upheavals and\\nconflicts in society. All the western states had strong conservative political groups who\\nparticipated in elections, and had influence in the administrative machinery.\\nSocialism\\nSocialists also criticized the liberals, but for things very different from the conserva-\\ntives. The socialists represented the interests of the working people, and argued that\\nin industrialist capitalist societies the old tyranny of the monarchy and the aristocracy\\nhad been replaced by that of the propertied capitalist bourgeoisie. Some earlier social-\\nists, such as Louis Blanc and Robert Owen believed that co-operatives of producers\\nwould lead to more equal sharing of profits.\\nOthers, like Karl Marx, thought that workers would never be fairly rewarded under\\nthe capitalist system. This would happen only if all enterprises were commonly owned\\ni. e., if the state owned them for the equal benefit of all. Marx said that in a communist\\nsociety when all means of production were held in common and were not private\\nproperty, each person will contribute according to his/her capacity and receive ac-\\ncording to his/her needs. Social justice therefore required abolition of private prop-\\nerty. Classes would also cease to exist in a society which was equal. According to\\nhim the ultimate goal of the socialist movements was the establishment of such a\\nsociety. Marx also said that since the ruling classes would not co-operate in this, a\\nrevolution was necessary. There should be communist parties and strong and com-\\nmitted working class movements.\\nThus, the Social Democratic (Marxist) Party in 1900 organised millions of workers\\ninto labour unions, clubs and associations, participated in elections, and held a huge\\nblock of seats in the Reichstag (German parliament). They were able to get passed\\nlegislation to improve the lives of the workers. Marxist, socialist and labour parties\\nexisted in many parts of the world by 1900, though they were under tremendous\\nsurveillance by the governments and police of their countries who wanted to prevent\\nrevolutions at all costs. In countries like Russia the socialist organizations were banned\\nand known socialists were imprisoned or exiled (as happened to V.I Lenin, a leader of\\nthe Russian revolutionary movement).\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 22.3\\n1.\\nWhat were the ‘natural rights’ recognized by liberals?\\n2.\\nWhy were liberals in principle opposed to govt. regulation of economic activity?\\n3.\\nDescribe the shifting class argument of the later 19th century with regard to\\nliberalism & conservatism.\\n91\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\n4.\\nExplain the Marxist conception of equality and Marxists’  understanding of basis\\nof inequality.\\n5.\\nGive one example of a country in 1900 where Marxists were very successful in\\nmobilizing working class people.\\n6.\\nSocialists (Marxists) are the most consistent opponents of imperialism. Why?\\nImperialism\\nThe world of 1900 was one in which the more industrialized states had power over\\nthe people and resources of the unindustrialized world. Many inhabitants of the indus-\\ntrialized countries believed that colonialism was beneficial for the countries that were\\nbeing ruled and that the inhabitants of the ‘backward’ countries were being ‘civilised’\\nby foreign rule. Liberals in the ruling countries were divided over how the dominance\\nof their countries over the colonies should be maintained. Not everyone thought that\\ndirect political rule was necessary: but none were willing to let go of the benefits of\\ncolonialism and the control over resources in the colonies. In Germany the liberals\\nargued that their country’s industrial power depended on taking more colonies. In the\\nUS many liberals said that their country had no moral right to rule over Cubans and\\nFilipinos, but hardly any US citizens criticized their government’s interventions in\\nLatin America. British, French, German, Belgian and American capitalists invested\\nheavily in economic activities both within and outside the formal empires. They there-\\nfore supported as well as influenced the foreign policies of their respective countries\\nand pushed for colonial domination of the rest of the world—countries comprising\\nAfrica, Latin America and Asia.\\nThe political groups in 1900 that had the most consistent anti-imperialist views were\\nthe socialists, who believed that colonialism benefited only the ruling classes every-\\nwhere and was not in the interest of the working people anywhere. Therefore the\\nworking classes of all the countries needed to unite to overthrow this imperialist\\ndomination by a few countries.\\nNationalism\\nNationalism and national liberation ideology was an explosive force in the world of\\nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In all parts of the world in 1900 competing\\nnationalisms flourished and became important forms of mobilization of people. Broader\\nnotions of civilisational identity competed with nationalism in winning support of the\\npeople. Both were important in Asia and Africa. Pan (‘All’)-Africanism and Pan-\\nIslamism fueled freedom struggles in the colonies. The Chinese and Indians empha-\\nsized their cultural independence as well as opposition to colonial policies in their\\nstruggle for freedom. Popular participation in government was also an important as-\\npect of national movements. Protest against colonial policies of the imperialist coun-\\ntries-economic exploitation and denial of self governance-formed the basis for na-\\ntional liberation movements all over the world. Most national freedom struggles of the\\ntwentieth century thus engaged with ideas about democracy and also with ideas of\\nhow national wealth should be produced and shared.\\n92\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE WORLD IN 1900: THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEGACY\\nIn contrast, within the industrialized, imperialist countries, nationalism became ag-\\ngressive and tied with support to colonial policies and domination of other countries,\\nwhich, as you will see in your study of the following Units, led to intense competition\\namong those countries and eventually to World War I.\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nThe century before 1900 was a period of rapid population growth, with the most\\nstriking growth occurring in Europe and North America. Population growth in\\nthese places occurred in tandem with industrialization. The emergence of indus-\\ntrial society led to the formation and solidification of ideologies – sets of ideas\\nand principles about achievement of the desired social order. By 1900, ideologies\\nwe beginning to shape the struggles of people in non-industrial societies for lib-\\neration from empires. In particular, nationalism and socialism were to have an\\nexplosive impact within ‘developed’ Europe as well as in the ‘undeveloped’\\ncolonial world.\\nTERMINAL QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nIn what ways did industrialization alter ancient patterns of human existence?\\n2.\\nHow did industrialization change patterns of global production and trade?\\n3.\\nHow were liberalism and socialism opposed to one another, even though both\\nsought to achieve human liberation?\\nANSWERS TO INTEXT QUESTION\\n22.1\\n1.\\n75-95%.\\n2.\\nInside of Europe.\\n3.\\nUrban areas were sites of industrial production and commercial distribution.

Troops from other areas-specifically colonies- were also\\nmade to fight in this war for countries which ruled over them. For example, Indian\\nsoldiers had to fight for Britain outside the territory of India. It is estimated that over\\nthree million men came from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and\\nIndia on the side of Britain (Britain ruled over these areas). The regions involved i. e.,\\nthe territories of the war zones were also widespread: the war engulfed Europe, Asia,\\nAfrica and the Pacific. For the first time almost the entire peoples of the world were\\ninvolved in a war, which they also knew was a world war.\\nThere were new technologies used in warfare, not seen in earlier wars: airplanes,\\ntanks and submarines. But it was fought on the ground in the ordinary way as well\\nand most people remembered it that way later because most images of war depicted\\nsoldiers fighting in trenches on ground. Sea battles took place in the South Atlantic\\n96\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nWorld War I and the Russian Revolution\\nand the Pacific. USA for the first time got involved on a world scale, with more than\\n100,000 troops on the side of Britain and her allies.\\nThe World War led to huge mobilizations of men as soldiers, while women took on\\nmany jobs back in the cities and also as nurses in the battle zones. Governments took\\nmany measures to ensure that their own armies do not run short of any supplies. Just\\nas they mobilized men they also mobilized grain for food from peasants. They cur-\\ntailed workers’ rights to make them work longer hours and for same wages to meet\\nthe needs of army equipment and ammunition. There was a rise in prices of food and\\narticles of daily consumption because major investments were only in industries re-\\nlated to war and other requirements of war. There was a general sense of despair\\namong people.\\nWe must also remember that there were 10 million who were killed in war or due to\\nhardships caused by war, another 20 million who were wounded, and millions who\\nbecame refugees or unemployed as towns and industries were destroyed.\\nHomelessness resulted not just on border areas of countries, but all over. Civilian\\npopulations were involved and became casualties for the first time in war history:\\nbombings of civilian areas, and the famines and epidemics caused by war, led to\\nmillions of civilian deaths.\\nWhen it began most people thought the war would be short: it lasted four years. You\\ncan imagine what life would have been like for people in countries involved in a war\\nfor four whole years. It dismantled quite a few of the existing socio-economic and\\npolitical structures. It affected the economy of the entire world. Because of the\\nspread and the mobilization of all resources by the warring states on such scale for\\nthe first time, it is known as the First World War.\\nFor all these reasons the war marked a turning point in world history.\\n23.2 REASONS FOR WAR\\nThe reasons for World War I are complex, although it was sparked off by a kind of\\nincident which could have happened anywhere at any time. There was hostility be-\\ntween Serbia and Austria during which Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, heir to throne of\\nHabsburg Empire was murdered at Sarajevo in 1914. This became the event which\\nspiraled into World War I.\\nBut why did one incident have such devastating consequences as to finally lead the\\nentire world into a four year war?\\nYou have already read about the race for colonies in an earlier lesson, and how in the\\nsecond half of the nineteenth century there was a full fledged imperialist system in\\nplace. For example, in 1876 no more than 10 percent of Africa was under European\\nrule, but by 1900 more than 90 percent was colonized. You have also seen that\\nGermany had been left behind in this race, and now it began to feel that she too\\nwanted her own colonies to rule over. By 1914 these powers were ready to increase\\ntheir own respective spheres of influence, to bring more areas under each one’s\\ncontrol, and to have a larger share in the resources of the world.\\nAs most of the world was already divided amongst them, each one could increase its\\nown areas of control, economically or politically, only by ‘reordering’ the world, or\\nfighting each other to increase their own share at the expense of another. Though none\\nof them thought in terms of a big war, yet potential for conflict was always there.\\n97\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n World War I and the Russian Revolution\\nThey made short wars for gaining new territories from another country or to protect\\nterritories already under their control, and sometimes in order to check a rival they\\nentered into alliance with another power. Bismarck of Germany entered into an alli-\\nance with Austria-Hungary in 1879, known as Dual Alliance, which became the Triple\\nAlliance when Italy joined in 1882. On the other side France in 1894 made an alliance\\nwith Russia, in 1904 France made an agreement with Britain and in 1907 Britain\\nmade an entente with Russia. This came to known as Triple Entente.\\nThe leaders of Europe thought these alliances would prevent war through a balance\\nof power: in fact what happened was that these alliances tied the countries together.\\nWhen one country went to war the others would have to get involved to help their\\nally. The rivalries and conflicts among the imperialist countries thus became the un-\\nderlying causes of the War.\\nNationalist movements were an important feature of the nineteenth century. By the\\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth century nationalism also underwent a transforma-\\ntion. In the advanced capitalist countries it became linked with extending areas of\\ncontrol and increasing one’s military strength. The dominating perception was no\\nlonger one that came with the French revolution and its ideals of ‘Liberty, Equality,\\nand Fraternity’. These countries were also no longer concerned with the idea of\\npopular sovereignty in a nation. On the other hand within multi national empires like\\nAustria-Hungary and the Russian Empire people wanted to free themselves and\\nform independent nations, which all big powers were opposed to.\\nThe big powers therefore went in for an unprecedented arms race, and building up of\\nhuge armies and navies. Militarism became the main aspect of foreign policy. Do-\\nmestic policies were aimed at increasing strength vis a vis other powers rather than\\nthe welfare of their own citizens. Mass media was made into a major tool: newspa-\\npers played an important role in the spread of aggressive nationalism.\\nIn 1901 relatively few people were permitted to vote anywhere, and women practi-\\ncally nowhere. Most citizens therefore hardly had an influence on policy making of\\ntheir governments.  The governments were guided by the interests of capitalists and\\nlandlords and under their influence they competed among themselves for increasing\\nareas of control under them. Although ordinary people hardly had a stake in this\\ncompetition, once the war broke out people did come forward with support for their\\nrespective countries.\\nThe horrors of modern war were still not understood. It was the impact of war that\\nmade people reconsider the war and begin to demand peace.\\n23.3 COURSE OF WAR\\nWe will not go into the details of the course of war or the major campaigns.  But you\\nshould know that Austria regarded the murder in Serbia as provocation for war, and once\\nshe decided to retaliate, her Triple Alliance partners Germany and Italy were drawn in on\\nher side, and the other powers (Britain, France and Russia) came on the opposing side.\\nGermany sent troops towards France and seemed to be succeeding, when Russia\\nattacked Germany and Austria from the east. The war became long drawn and more\\ncomplicated. Fighting in the trenches on the ground continued for four years as both\\nsides were evenly matched. Labour from colonies was used for digging trenches.\\nThen the war spread to areas in Asia and Africa.\\n98\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nWorld War I and the Russian Revolution\\nUse of technology during the war meant heavy casualties for all countries. For\\nexample, on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 60, 000 British soldiers were\\nkilled or wounded.\\nItaly changed sides during the course of the war. In April 1917 the US also declared\\nwar on Germany. The decisive element at this stage was the revolutionary movement\\nin the Russian Empire.\\nIn October 1917 the Russian revolution was successful and Russia came out of the\\nwar when communists emerged in leadership there. They signed a peace treaty with\\nGermany in March 1918. This treaty was very harsh on Russia, but the new regime\\nin Russia, led by Lenin, agreed to it because they had been opposed to the war from\\nthe beginning.\\nThis complicated matters: not only to Germany, but also to Britain and France, the\\nnew Russia seemed a bigger enemy because they were fundamentally opposed to\\ncommunism.\\nTherefore when the fortunes of battle began to turn by the beginning of 1918 and the\\nGerman armies began to retreat, Britain and France agreed to a peace. In Germany\\ntoo, as in Russia, the workers threatened revolution. Armistice came into effect on\\nNovember 11, 1918, and then all the powers together put their strength into trying to\\ndefeat the revolution in Russia. You will learn something about it in the next section.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 23.1\\n1.\\nWhat were the new weapons used in World War I?\\n2.\\nName the two main international alliances formed by 1914.\\n3.\\nHow many people were affected by World War I?\\n4.\\nWhich side did Indian soldiers fight on in World War I?\\n23.4 THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION, 1917\\nThe Russian Revolution was made in 1917, before the end of the War. It is also\\nknown as the Bolshevik revolution, because Bolsheviks as a political group played a\\nleading role in the success of the revolution and also determined its policies.\\nThis was the first socialist revolution in history and it was inspired by the ideals of\\ncommunism. In your earlier lessons you have learnt something about capitalism and\\nthe ideas of socialism, and how socialism represents equality and social justice to a\\ngreater degree than is possible under capitalism. The revolution came about as a\\nresult of the movements of the working people—the working class and the peasantry.\\nBy 1917 the Russian Empire was under strain both from the consequences of the\\nlong war and by the political and social movements within the country. Up to Febru-\\nary 1917 Russia was a multinational Empire, ruled by an autocrat, who was known as\\n99\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n World War I and the Russian Revolution\\nthe Tsar. Its territory was huge, including a large part of Central Asia and parts of\\nEastern Europe. There were no representative institutions, no right to form political or\\ntrade union organizations, no elections. There was strict censorship and arbitrary\\narrests. There was no religious tolerance, and the other nationalities and minorities in\\nthe Empire did not enjoy equal rights with the Russians, because the Tsar, Nicholas II,\\nbelonged to the Russian Romanov dynasty. The Tsar used his military and diplomatic\\nstrength against all democratic movements in Europe. For this he was known as the\\n‘Policeman’ of Europe. These conditions were very oppressive and very different\\nfrom Western Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century.\\n23.5 THE OLD AND THE NEW\\nWhile the political system remained an autocracy, important changes were taking\\nplace in economy and society, which created new aspirations. New ideas were also\\nemerging, and many sections of society were becoming dissatisfied with the oppres-\\nsive rule of the Tsar. Since they had no parliamentary system or elections through\\nwhich to express their opposition to the Tsarist policies, they had to adopt a revolu-\\ntionary path.  They had to overthrow the system of autocracy itself to have a say in\\nsociety and policies which affected them. This was a major difference between other\\nEuropean countries and the Russian Empire.\\n23.6 AGRICULTURE AND PEASANT DISCONTENT\\nThe peasants were also very discontented. As in western and central Europe, the\\npeasant-serfs were freed in the Russian Empire as well, although very much later, in\\n1861. But despite this land reform, the landed aristocracy remained strong and con-\\ntinued to oppress the peasants. Also, the peasantry just did not have enough land: the\\npeasants constituted about 80 percent of the population, but had hardly 50 percent of\\nthe land. The demand for land was therefore a major cause for anger against the Tsar\\nwho had let them down by such an inadequate land reform.\\nAlso the freed peasants had to pay very heavily for both land and freedom, because\\nthe Tsar was interested in keeping the goodwill and support of the big landlords by\\ngiving more than fair compensation to them. The peasants had to pay such a heavy\\nprice that they remained continually in debt, and were forced to work very cheaply\\nfor the landlords. Peasants were also very heavily burdened with taxes.\\nAgriculture remained backward because the peasants did not have enough money to\\ninvest in the improvement of their land, and the landlords thought: why pay for buying\\nmachinery if peasants are there as cheap labour?\\nIn all matters of interest to the peasants the autocracy sided with the landlords, and\\nsent out troops to suppress peasant revolts. Since agriculture was the major sector of\\nRussian economy and peasants were the majority population, the agricultural back-\\nwardness and the peasant discontent became important factors for the revolution.\\nThere were continuous peasant uprisings during the 19th century, and in the early 20th\\ncentury they became part of the general revolutionary movement.\\n23.7 INDUSTRIALISATION AND WORKERS’ DISCONTENT\\nThe workers movement in the Russian Empire was stronger and more political than\\nanywhere else in Europe. This had something to do with the nature of industrialization\\nhere and the political conditions in the Russian Empire. Industrialization in Russia was\\n100\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nWorld War I and the Russian Revolution\\nlate as compared to Western Europe, but it was at a much faster pace. This meant\\nthat there were small, but also many huge factories with a great number of workers,\\neven in the early stages of industrialization. Working class movements were there-\\nfore able to develop here much faster than they had in the west European countries,\\nand the capitalists here did not get time to consolidate their power before the working\\nclass movement became strong. Many strikes took place in the last decade of the\\nnineteenth century, and by 1905 the workers played a leading role in the revolutionary\\nmovement.\\nThe workers’ movement in the Russian Empire was also much more militant and\\npolitical than in other countries; and it was both against the Autocracy which did not\\nallow them to form organizations and sided with their employers, and against the\\nemployers who were the factory owners and responsible for their low wages and bad\\nworking conditions. Their movement also had a greater orientation towards socialism\\nthan in other countries.\\nBy the first decade of the 20th century women constituted a sizeable percentage of\\nthe working class and also working class organizations, as a result of which many\\nissues pertaining to them began to be reflected in the discussions on workers’ rights\\nand women’s equality. Working class women participated in a big way in working\\nclass movements.\\n23.8 DISCONTENT AMONG NATIONALITIES\\nThe relationship between the Russian Romanov dynasty and the other nationality\\nregions was almost colonial in nature, with these areas being used as sources of raw\\nmaterial for development of industries in Russian regions. You may remember that\\nsomething like that happened to India as well under British colonial rule. These na-\\ntionalities such as the Caucasians, the Polish, the Kazakhs, the Latvians, the Esto-\\nnians and others played an important role in overthrowing the Russian autocracy.\\n23.9 LEADERSHIP AND VISION\\nFor a revolutionary movement to succeed it is necessary that there should be a com-\\nmitted leadership, it should be guided by certain ideals and should have a programme\\nof change. In other words, people should not merely like to destroy something; they\\nshould also have an idea of what they want to build, and of how to go about bringing\\nchange. They should be able to form organizations to take forward their movements.\\nMany political groups were active during the first half of the 20th century, but they\\nwere illegal and had to work underground, hunted by the Tsarist police and subject to\\nsevere repression and punishment if found out. However, they played a very heroic\\nand significant role in raising the consciousness of the people-particularly of the workers\\nand peasants-through political education, political propaganda and agitation. Millions\\nof organizations were formed on the ground among all sections of society-of workers,\\npeasants and soldiers, of students and teachers, of all types of employees, and of\\nwomen. Many of these organizations had close links with political parties and were\\nvery responsive to political discussions and ideas.\\nBy 1917 women’s organizations began to reflect working women’s interests as well,\\nas did working class organizations, although women had to fight continuously for such\\nattention. Although women constituted a big share in popular movements, there were\\nstill very few women in leadership roles.\\n101\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n World War I and the Russian Revolution\\nThe important political groups were Populists (in late 19th century) and Social Revo-\\nlutionaries, various types of Liberals and the Social Democrats (Marxists). Social\\nDemocrats had two parties, Bolshevik (meaning majority in Russian) and Menshevik\\n(meaning minority). They got these names after they split as a result of differences.\\nThese groups had different ideas about how to bring about a revolution, of how to\\nchange the Russian society and political system.\\nLenin was the most important leader of the Russian revolution of 1917. Another was\\nTrotsky. Both were Bolsheviks. It would be correct to say however that there were\\nthousands of important leaders, both men and women, just as there were in our free-\\ndom movement, without whose work, heroism and sacrifices the revolution could not\\nhave succeeded.\\n23.10 STAGES OF THE REVOLUTION\\nThe Russian revolutionary movement emerged in the 19th century, when some members\\nof the aristocracy began to feel that the Tsarist political system was too oppressive\\nand Russian society too unjust. They particularly felt for the plight of the peasantry.\\nHow could Russia progress if the majority of its people were in such a sorry condi-\\ntion? These members of the aristocracy and the newly emerged middle class formed\\nthe intelligentsia, who criticized Russian society and political system and worked for\\nits transformation. They formed secret societies and small political groups. They could\\nnot campaign or work openly to spread their ideas because of the strict censorship\\nand ban on political activity. They became dedicated revolutionaries. They demanded\\na constitution and elections. Many women were active revolutionaries. When caught\\nthey were given cruel punishments. Yet the movement grew.\\nAs workers and peasants became confident of fighting the injustices of their lives,\\nthey also began to struggle against the Autocracy. When they came into contact with\\nrevolutionaries both the movements were enriched. By early 20th century the Russian\\nrevolutionary movement was a mass based movement, and ‘Revolution’ became the\\nrallying cry.\\nThe first major popular attack on the Autocracy, took place in 1905. This great revo-\\nlutionary upsurge was unsuccessful, and the movements were suppressed. But\\nbecause the people learnt many important lessons through this experience, Lenin later\\ncalled it the “dress rehearsal’ for the 1917 revolution. The main demands were a\\n“democratic republic’, universal franchise, land for peasantry, and higher wages and\\na shorter working day for workers. Women’s equality, right of self determination for\\nthe different nationalities and abolition of capital punishment were other demands.\\nFor the first time there was a General Strike. Sections of the army and navy also\\nrevolted, and a revolutionary organization of the working class known as Soviet was\\nformed. It played a leading role in the revolution.\\nMany years of repression followed, but the revolutionary movement picked up again\\nduring World War I as larger and larger sections of people began to directly feel the\\nimpact of war and to understand the nature of tsarist policies. The puppet Cabinet did\\nnot function and the weak parliament (Duma) could not address popular aspirations.\\nBy 1917 majority of the people of the Russian empire were determined to overthrow\\nthe Autocracy and to take matters in their own hands. In this atmosphere the Febru-\\nary revolution was sparked off by shortages of bread, and a demonstration of women\\nwho called on the soldiers to support their brothers and sisters rather than the Tsar\\n102\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nWorld War I and the Russian Revolution\\nwho oppressed them. The soldiers who were also fed up with the war did not fire on\\nthe agitating people.\\nA few days later came the demand: ‘Down with Autocracy’. Red flags dominated\\nthe cityscape of St Petersburg, the capital city, and soon the entire territory of the\\nEmpire was aflame with cries of revolution. The Autocracy was overthrown and\\nreplaced by a Provisional Government. The workers and peasants played an impor-\\ntant role in this change, and the bourgeoisie supported it. Even the soldiers came to\\nthe side of the revolutionary forces. St.Petersburg was renamed Petrograd.\\nThe Provisional government created conditions for political freedoms, such as right of\\nforming organizations and freedom of speech, but did not bring any major change in\\npolicies which affected people; it could not have, as this government was dominated\\nby parties representing landlord and capitalist interests. The workers, soldiers and\\npeasants, along with the Bolshevik party, therefore continued with their movements\\nwhich culminated in the October-Bolshevik revolution of 1917.\\nThe Bolsheviks were the only political group in tune with the aspirations of the people\\nin 1917: they called for an immediate end to War; they demanded land for peasants,\\nworkers’ control over industries, and right of nations to self determination. Peace!\\nBread! Land! Democracy! became the slogans in all the mass organizations of the\\nworkers, peasants and soldiers all over the country, and Bolsheviks were elected to\\ntheir leaderships in a majority in these organizations.\\nThe October 1917 revolution thus had a popular base and was not simply a military\\ncoup that overthrew the Provisional Government. You should also remember that\\nalthough it is known as October revolution, it took place on November 7 1917, and is\\ncelebrated on November 7, because after the revolution Russia adopted the interna-\\ntional calendar. Prior to that Russia was following it is own calendar which was 10\\ndays behind the calendar followed internationally.\\n23.11 POLICIES AND IMPACT OF THE REVOLUTION\\nRevolutionary Russia not only changed the policies of Tsarist Russia, it also did many\\nthings that were different and more just than what existed in capitalist countries of\\nEurope. Its policies laid the foundations of socialism in Russia.\\nKnowing fully well that people were tired of war and wanted peace, and that war\\nwas not in the interest of people in any country, one of its first acts was to withdraw\\nfrom the war.\\nThe Bolsheviks abolished private property in the means of production i.e., land, facto-\\nries, and banks, all of which were nationalized and now owned by the state and not by\\nprivate owners. This means that they could not be used to exploit the labour of others\\nand make private profit anymore. Workers organizations had a greater say in the\\ndecision making processes.\\nThrough the land decree of November 1917 landlordism was abolished and land was\\ngiven over to peasants for hereditary use. Peasants could not sell or mortgage the\\nland or use it to exploit the labour of others, but they were masters of their land and\\nenjoyed the full fruits of their labour and produce from the land. They did not have to\\ndepend on former landlords in any way, whose powers over rural economy and\\nsociety were demolished.\\n103\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n World War I and the Russian Revolution\\nThese measures meant that the Russian people became equal beneficiaries of the re-\\nsources and economy of the country. It also became possible now to plan centrally for\\nthe benefit of all parts and all sections of the people. This system of centralized planning\\nwas seen as important and was adopted by many countries, including India.\\nThe new constitution guaranteed free medical care, free and equal education for all,\\nan unemployment allowance, equal access to culture and cultural advancement. Not\\nall of this was immediately available, but by making these a right for all, the new\\nregime showed the direction of its policy and commitment. The differentials between\\npeople holding middle class type of jobs and those working on land or in the factories\\nwere far less than in other countries-both in terms of salaries and entitlement to\\nfacilities provided by the state. Standard of life was not dependent on whether one\\ncould personally pay, because many things did not have to be paid for.\\nWomen were not just considered equal; a lot of measures were taken to make their\\nequal participation in social and political life possible: maternity leave, public canteens,\\nfree crèches at workplaces etc.\\nThey considered their state the ‘dictatorship of the working class’ because the work-\\ning, ordinary people and their welfare was now the basis of polity and policies.\\nThe new regime gave moral and some physical support to independence struggles\\nagainst colonial rule, and recognized the right of all nationalities to decide their own\\nfuture. For this reason the Russian revolution was lauded in all Asian countries and\\ninspired people all over the world. China and India were also greatly influenced by the\\nRussian revolution. There was spread of socialist ideas.\\nNationalist leaders in India realized the significance of the intervention of peasants\\nand workers in political struggles. People in India sensed that a ‘kisan-mazdoor raj’\\nhas been established in Russia. The 1920’s thus saw the formation of Workers and\\nPeasants Parties, the All India Trade Union Congress, and increasing efforts in India\\nto organize workers and peasants.\\nThe imperialist countries were however opposed to the Revolution and they sent their\\ntroops to defeat the new Bolshevik regime. They were not successful, and the new\\nrevolutionary regime  survived, due mainly to the support of the people and the dedi-\\ncation of the revolutionaries. What happened in Russia and Europe following the\\nRussian revolution and the end of World War I is another story, which you will read\\nabout in the next lesson.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 23.2\\n1.\\nWhat was the political system in Russia before the Revolution?\\n2.\\nWhat other name is the Russian Revolution of 1917 known as?\\n3.\\nName the important political groups in Tsarist Russia.\\n4.\\nWhat is meant by abolition of private property?\\n104\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nWorld War I and the Russian Revolution\\nWHAT YOU HA\\nVE LEARNT\\nWorld War I was very different from the previous wars in history because it con-\\nnected the whole would in its violence and suffering.

Yet, the\\ndevelopments during the next twenty years, led the world into another war-more\\ndestructive, more widespread and much larger in scale. In order to understand the\\nreasons for the outbreak of this war, we need to study the inter-war period in detail.\\nThe end of the First World War did not end the rivalries between the European nation.\\nEven the peace Treaties failed to ensure peace. The treaties were harsh on the\\ndefeated countries and thus sowed the seeds of future conflicts. They even failed to\\nsatisfy the territorial ambitions of some of the allied powers. In many of the countries\\nstrong dictators rose to power and spread the message of national chauvinism. The\\nmost important fact was that, imperialism, the basic cause of war, was not destroyed.\\nThe Russian Revolution and the emergence of the Soviet Union also divided the\\nworld into two groups-those who favored the revolution and those who fear\\neffects. Most of the west European countries belonged to the latter group. They\\nconsidered socialism to be a threat to their social and economic systems. Soviet\\nRussia was also anti-imperialist and supported the freedom struggles in the colo-\\nnies of Asia and Africa. This chapter will tell you how all these combined to\\ncreate conditions for another war.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying the lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\nanalyze the peace treaties and the changed map of Europe;\\n \\ntrace the rise of totalitarian regimes – Italy, Germany and Japan;\\n \\nexplain effects of Great Depression on U.S.A., U.S.S.R and Europe ;\\n \\ncorrelate aggression and appeasement and\\n \\nexplain the course of war.\\n107\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\n24.1 THE PEACE TREATIES\\nThe First World War ended with the signing of the peace treaties at a conference held\\nin Paris. The important leaders at the conference were the U.S. President Woodrow\\nWilson, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and the French Prime Minister\\nGeorge Clemenceau.\\nLeague of nations:\\nOne of the first acts of the peace conference was the decision to create a world\\norganization, called the League of Nations, for the promotion of ‘international coop-\\neration, peace and security. The Covenant (formal agreement) of the League was\\napproved in April 1919.\\nThe agreement required all member to reduce armaments in the interest of peace. If any\\nmember country resorted to war, then collective action would be taken against that coun-\\ntry. The trade relations with the aggressor country would also be cut off. However, the\\nLeague of Nations could never be an effective organization. Two major countries-Soviet\\nUnion and Germany - were not allowed to become its members for many years. United\\nStates, despite its leading role in the formation of the League, decided not to join it. Hence,\\nwhen aggression began in the 1930s, the League failed to prevent it.\\nThe Treaty of Versailles:\\nThe peace treaties were to be based on President Wilson’s peace proposals or Four-\\nteen Points, which promised to bring in an era of peace, freedom, democracy, self-\\ndetermination (the right to have a say in one’s own government). But these principles\\nwere ignored when the allies signed the Treaty of Versailles with Germany.\\nAccording to the treaty:\\n1. Germany was blamed as the aggressor and forced to accept responsibility\\nfor the damage caused to the Allies during war.\\n2. Germany was to pay $6,600 million as compensation to them.\\n3.

Germany surrendered Alsace\\nLorraine to France, which it had captured in 1871. In the north it gave up some\\nareas to Belgium and Denmark. The area given to Poland has already been men-\\ntioned. Apart from losses in Europe, Germany also gave up right on its African\\ncolonies and privileges in China. Thus, after war, the Germans were a discon-\\ntented lot.\\nItaly has fought the war on the Allied side to satisfy her territorial ambitions in Aus-\\ntria, Turkish Empire and Africa. But all that Italy gained from the peace settlement\\nwas a small part of Austria.\\nRussia suffered more casualties in war than all the Allies put together. It withdrew\\nfrom war in March 1918 after signing a treaty with Germany. By this treaty it ac-\\ncepted the independence of  Poland, Finland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia\\nand Lithuania. Added to this were the proplems of civil war, military intervention and\\neconomic collapse.\\nPoland, which had disappeared from the map in 1815, after being annexed by the\\nthree empires of Austria, Prussia and Russia, now reappeared when the three em-\\npires declined together. However, the old enmity with the new neighboring countries\\ncould not be wiped out so easily.\\nBy a separate treaty, Austria was reduced to a small state and it lost all its imperial\\nglory. Austria recognized the independence of the newly formed countries of Hun-\\ngary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. You would remember that Italy had\\nalso gained some territory at the cost of Austria. All the newly formed countries had\\nto deal with the problems of border disputed, political upheavals and economic diffi-\\nculties.\\nBritain was given Palestime and Iraq as MANDATES and France was given\\nSyria. They would administer them till the people learnt to govern themselves. But\\nthese Mandates were also governed as colonies.\\nThe treaty with Turkey resulted in the complete dismemberment of the Turkish Em-\\npire. Turkey lost its Arab possessions in North Africa, in Southwest Asia and almost\\nall its territories in Europe. Some of these territories came under British and French\\ncontrol as mandates. Russia and Greece also gained some areas. Turkey was thus\\nreduced to a small state. The Turks rose in rebellion against the treaty under the\\nleadership of Mustafa Komal. The Sultan was removed from power and a republic\\nwas established in Turkey in 1923 with Mustafa Kemal as its first president. He\\nbegan the process of modernization of the country. The people called him ‘ATATURK’\\nor Father of the Turks.\\nYou have just read about the changes that occurred in various European countries.\\nAn understanding of these changes tells us that most countries remained dissatisfied\\nwith the peace treaties. Was another re-division of the world necessary? Was an-\\nother war the only solution?\\nThis chapter will help you find the answers.\\n111\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 24.1\\nA.

These included reorganization of the economy, resettlement of the survivors of\\nwar, and growing unemployment. The working classes in many countries tried to\\norganize socialist revolutions on the Soviet pattern, but they were ruthlessly suppressed.\\nIn their place, strong, anti-democratic movements arose in Hungary, Poland, Italy,\\nPortugal, Germany and Spain, which can generally be termed as ‘Fascist’.\\nEmergence of Fascism in Italy:\\nThe term ‘Fascism’ is of Italian origin and was first used for the movement started\\nby Beni to Mussolini in Italy. The fascists adopted as their symbol ‘the fasces’ or a\\nbundle of rods, which represented state power. The main features of these move-\\nments were opposition to democracy and socialism, establshiment of dictatorial rule,\\nextreme nationalsm and militarism.\\nMussolini made eloquent speeches about the glory of ancient Roman Empire and\\nurged people to restore Italy’s honor. Many ex-soldiers, after listening to his speeches,\\njoined his armed gangs, which was a private army called ‘Blackshirts’.  Mussolini\\nused these gangs to break up strikes and to spread terror among the socialists and\\ncommunists. The ruling classes of Italy did not curb their action because they also\\nwanted to prevent a socialist revolution.\\nIn 1921, Mussolini set up the National Fascist Party. In  October next year, he sent\\n30,000 of his Blackshirts in a march on Rome. The government surrendered without\\na fight and the king asked Mussolini to form the new government. By 1928, Mussolini\\nhad destroyed all parliamentary opposition and had begun to rule as  a dictator. All\\nnon-fasicst parties were banned. He used imprisonment corture and organized kill-\\nings to suppress the socialists and the communists. He set up the Fascist Grand\\n112\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\nCouncil and took the title of II Duce of The Leader. He tried to make Italy a great\\npower by advocating a policy of war and expansion.\\nHitler and Nazi Germany:\\nYou already know about the humiliating defeat of Germany and the downfall of its\\nmonarchy. In 1919, a Republician form of government was established under a new\\nconstitution, which provided for a President, a Chancellor and an elected Parliament.\\nDuring the world war, Adolf Hitler had been a soldier in the German army and had\\nfought bravely for four years, winning an Iron Cross. Disappointed at Germany’s\\ndefeat, he now decided to join poltics. In 1921, Hitler’s powerful speeches and his\\norganizational skills made him the leader of the National socialist German Workers’\\nParty, in short, the Nazi party. Like Fascists, it had its own army called the ‘Storm Troop-\\ners’ or the ‘Brownshirts.’ By 1930, the Brown shirts number about 100,000 men.\\nAfter the Fascist  captured power in Italy, Corporal Adolf Hitler made a similar\\nattempt in Germany in 1923. The attempt failed and Hitler was jailed. While in jail\\nHitler wrote his book Mein Kampf (My struggle), in which he set out his plans to\\ncreate the most barbaric dictatorship of modern times.\\nThe 1936 Olympics were held in Berlin. Hitler wanted to use the games to prove\\nhis theory of Aryan racial superiority. But his attempt failed as the most popular\\nhero of the games was an Afro-American sprinter –Jesse Owems.\\nThe aim of Nazi policies was to wipe out the humiliation of Versailles and to make\\nGermany powerful and feared in the world.\\nThe Nazis were similar to Fascism in their opposition to democracy, civil liberties and\\nsocialism. They used brutal force to crush any opposition.\\nHitler put the blame for Germany’s defeat in war on the Jews, so extermination of the\\nJewish race became an important feature of Nazism. He believed in the purity and\\nsuperiority of the German race-calling them pure blood Aryans-and wanted the union\\nof all Germans to create a Greater Germany. A very large section of the people were\\nmarked by the Nazi politcs. They appealed to the national pride of Germans and\\ngained support for Nazi politics.\\nThe economic development of the 1930s helped in Hitler’s rise to power. A severe\\ndepression hit America and Europe. As a result almost 8 million workers in Germany\\nbecame unemployed. The Nazi party now began to spread its influence. The Com-\\nmunists and the Socialists failed to unite against the Nazis. Consequently, the Nazi\\nparty, which had won only 12 seats in the Parliament in 1928, became the single\\nLargest party in 1932. President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor and asked\\nhim to form the new government.\\nSoon after coming to power, Hitler unleashed a reign of terror. All democratic prin-\\nciples were put aside. In February 1933, the Nazis set the Parliament building on fire\\nand put the blame on the socialists and communists. Over 60,000 people were impris-\\noned or sent to concentration camps. By mid-1933 all political parties, other than the\\nNazi party, were banned. Following Hindenburg’s death on August 2 1934, Hitler\\nbecame the President of Germany. An organized campaign for the total\\n113\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\nextermination of Jews was launched. Simultaneously a programme of militarization\\nwas introduced. The victory of Nazism brought the world closer to war.\\nHitler was so ruthless that he ordered the killings of hundreds of storm Troopers,\\nwho had helped in his rise to power, in one night. June 30 1934 is known as the\\nnight of Long Knives.\\nMilitary Fascism in Japan:\\nJapan had been the only country in Asia to escape colonization. By the end of the\\nnineteenth century, Japan’s expansionist policy led her to a war with China. The\\ndefeat of China enabled Japan to gain a foothold in the country. In 1905, Japan de-\\nfeated Russia in war and took over Manchuria, the Russian sphere of influence in\\nChina. This was the first instance of an Asian country defeating a mighty European\\nnation in war. Later Japan also annexed Korea.\\nThe outbreak of the First World War gave her a chance to acquire Germany’s pos-\\nsessions in China and some German-held islands in the Pacific. After the war the\\nLeague gave her the mandate over the islands. By this time, Japan’s military had\\nbecome a dominating force in society. It destroyed democracy within the country and\\nadvocate of extreme nationalism and expansionism. In less than fifty years Japan\\nchanged from a peaceful country to an aggressive military power.

While the\\nwar damaged the economy of the European countries, the U.S. economy became\\nstronger. No war was fought on the U.S. soil and the industrial expansion also contin-\\nued during war as it supplied arms and other materials to the Allies. However, a\\ndecade later serious economic problems arose in the country, which later spread to\\nthe rest of Europe.\\nYou know that America followed the capitalist system of production, in which maxi-\\nmum profit was made by the owners of industry. Most of the workers, however, lived\\nbelow the poverty line. Thus, not many people had the means to buy goods, which\\nwere being produced by the industries. So ‘overproduction’ and ‘maldistribution of\\npurchasing power’ were the two main causes of The Great Depression, which hit\\nU.S.A. in Oct. 1929 and then spread worldwide.\\nThe Crisis began with a fall in the share prices leading to a collapse of the U.S. stock\\nmarket. In one day, nearly 16 million shares were sold on the New York stock exchange.\\nDuring the next four years, almost 9000 banks closed operations and millions of people\\nlost their life’s savings.\\nAs goods remained unsold, thousands of factories shut down, resulting in unemploy-\\nment, poverty and starvation.\\nMost of the European countries, except Soviet Union, also suffered as they had\\nbecome dependent on the U.S. economy, especially on the American bank. The ef-\\nfects of the crisis in these countries were similar. The number of unemployed in the\\nworld rose to over 50 million, of which 15 million were in U.S. alone\\nThe economic crisis also affected the political conditions in these countries. In U.S.\\nthe Democratic Party came to power with Franklin D. Roosevelt as President. He\\nintroduced a programme of economic reform and social welfare called New Deal. In\\nBritain and France, labour friendly governments came to power. Though fascist move-\\nments arose in Britain and France they were not successful.\\nIn Germany and Italy as you have read above, post war discontent and Depression\\nled to victories of fascist parties.\\nDuring the 1930s the foreign polices of U.S, Britain and France were also similar.\\nThey did not adopt a strong position against the fascists. Their main concern was to\\ncheck the spread of socialist ideas and workers’ movements. Thus when fascist\\naggressetion began, they did nothing to check it. Instead they chose to appease Fas-\\ncism in the hope that it would destroy communism.\\nDevelopments in the USSR\\nWe have already discussed Russia’s participation in war and the Russian Revolution.\\nThis was followed by a civil war and the allied military intervention. All this had\\nresulted in the collapse of the Russian economy. There was a severe shortage of food\\nand the industrial production declined drastically.\\n115\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\nThe consequent famine worsened the conditions further.\\nLenin was forced to take strict measures. The soviet government forcibly seized\\nsurplus food from rich farmers (kulaks), to feed the rest of the population. Nothing\\ncould be bought or sold in the markets. The industrial produce was distributed to the\\nworkers in lieu of wages. People were encouraged and even forced to work for the\\ngood of their fellow men rather than for motive. This grim state of affairs, which\\nlasted from 1918–1921. was called ‘War Communism’.\\nThe fierce opposition to this system mainly from the peasantry and some members of\\nhis above party led Lenin to replace it by the New Economic Policy in 1921. The harsh\\nmeasures of War Communism were withdrawn. Now the peasant  gave one-tenth of\\ntheir produce as tax and were allowed to sell the rest in the open markets. Though  most\\nof the industries remained under state control, yet smaller industries were given back to\\nprivate owners. Payment of wages in cash was reintroduced.\\nA new constitution was introduced in 1924, under which Russia because the Union of\\nSoviet Socialist Republic. But after Lenin’s death in 1924 a fierce power struggle\\narose within the party. There  were serious differences among the senior leaders\\nover the policies to be followed. Finally, Stalin, emerged victorious, became the Gen-\\neral Secretary of the Communist Party, and soon assumed great powers.\\nWithin a few years, the U.S.S.R. started a vigorous program of industrialization through\\na series of Five Years Plans. The first plan was introduced in 1929. One of the aims\\nof the Plan was to bring about changes in agriculture. After the revolution, agricul-\\ntural land had been redistributed among peasants resulting in millions of small, less\\nproductive land holdings. To increase production, the government promoted the idea\\nof Collectivization of small farms. The peasants were both encouraged and forced to\\ngive up private ownership of farms, land was pooled and they had to become mem-\\nbers and joint owners of the collective farms. The kulaks, who opposed collectiviza-\\ntion, were severely dealt with. It is estimated that thousands perished during this\\nperiod.\\nThe main effort of the plan was towards industrialization. Here the success was\\ngreater and soon Soviet Russia emerged a major, industrial power in the world. It is\\nimportant to remember that the capitalist economies at this time faced a severe eco-\\nnomic crisis. The Soviet example of a successful socialist economy stood out and\\nwas adopted later by many colonies after independence. Most of the European coun-\\ntries and U.S.A., however, did not recognize Soviet Russia till 1933. It became a\\nmember of the League of Nations only in 1934. The hostility towards Soviet Union\\ncontinued even after this. When fascist aggression began in the 1930s, Soviet Union\\nwas the only major power that actively opposed them.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 24.3\\nA. Match the following :\\n1. New Deal\\nU.S.S.R\\n2.

In this\\nsection, we will see that most of the western powers not only remained mute specta-\\ntors to these acts but even supported some of them, thereby helping the fascists\\nprepare the stage for war.\\nJapanese invasion of Manchuria\\nThe first major act of aggression was the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931.\\nTrouble began with an explosion on the Japanese railway line and Japanese military\\nofficers used it as an excuse to take over Manchuria. China appealed to the League\\nof Nations but no action was taken. Japan quit the League of Nations and it launched\\nanother attack on China in 1937.\\nItaly takes over Ethiopia\\nIn 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia and an appeal was made to the League. The League\\ncondemned Italy as an aggressor and put a ban on the sale of arms to Italy. By 1936,\\nhowever, Italy completed the conquest of Ethiopia and the League, once again, failed\\nto resist aggression.\\nExpansion of Nazi Germany\\nIn our study of Hitler’s rise to power, we saw that he became the Chancellor as well\\nas the President of Germany. He then started the process of re-militarization of Ger-\\nmany in violation of the Treaty of Versailles.\\nThe German troops entered Rhineland, which had been demilitarized by the treaty.\\nMoreover, the troops now numbered 800,000 as against the Treaty limit of 100,000.\\nThe absence of any retaliatory action by France and Britain gave Hitler increased\\nconfidence to build up an Air force and a Navy. The Saar valley was also reunited\\nwith Germany. In 1936, Hitler and Mussolini signed the Rome-Berlin Axis, and in\\n1937, they signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan.\\n117\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nHISTORY\\n THE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\nHitler’s next Plan was the annexation of Austria.

By this pact, they agreed to the German\\noccupation of Sude tenland in Czechoslovakia. The Czechs had no role in these talks.\\nGermany wanted Sudetenland because this area had a large German population and\\nwas the hub of coal chemical and iron and steel industries.

It had serious consequence for the entire world and is\\nconsideredto be a dress rehearsal of the Second World War.\\nIn 1936, a Popular Front Government, comprising the socialists, communists and other\\nanti fascist parties, came to power in Spain. They formed a democratic republic under\\nthe leadership of General Franco, a section of the army planned to overthrow this\\ngovernment. Germany and Italy gave armed support to Franco’s men and German\\naircrafts carried out air raids on Spanish towns and villages.

Opera-\\ntion Barbarossa had failed, but the Germans would accept total defeat only after\\nsuffering another Russian winter, and a heroic resistance firm the Soviet Red Army.\\nA global war\\nSince the outbreak of war, U.S. had been sympathetic to Britain, allowing her to buy\\narms, first on a ‘Cash and carry’ basis and then on a ‘Lend – lease’ system. The\\nlatter deal was extended to the Soviet Union also in November 1941. However, U.S.\\nwas opposed to direct entry into the war.\\nHowever, on December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American naval\\nbase at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This resulted in the destruction of the American Pacific\\nFleet and the death of over 2000 soldiers. On December 8, US declared war on Japan\\nand, a few days later on Germany and Italy. The war had become truly global.\\nAfter Pearl Harbor, the Japanese advanced rapidly in the Far East, capturing Thai-\\nland, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines and Burma, by the middle of 1942.\\nThe fascist countries had reached the peak of their power.\\nThe battle of Stalingrad\\nDuring the summer of 1942, Hitler’s army continued its offensive in the Soviet Union.\\nHitler again hoped for victory but the advance of the German army was checked at\\nStalingrad. By November, the German armies were in an around Stalingrad, but they\\nwere encircled by the Soviet troops. All supplies to the German army cut off. The\\nRussian winter again took its toll and by January 31, 1943, the German army had\\ncollapsed. Germany and their allies lost almost 250,000 men in the battle, which marked\\nthe turning point in the war. Soviet Union also suffered very heavy losses in terms of\\ndead and wounded.\\nThe beginning of the end\\nMeanwhile the war in North Africa had developed into a battle between the Western\\nEighth Army under General Montgomery and the German Afrika Korps under Gen-\\neral Rommel, who had been sent by Hitler to help the Italian troops. In August 1942,\\nRommel began to move towards Egypt. The decisive battle was fought at E1 Alamein\\non the north coast of Egypt in October 1943, which led to Rommel’s retreat.\\nBy the summer of 1943, the Allies had taken over North Africa, In July, they invaded\\nSicily. Mussolini’s government was overthrown and Italy surrendered uncondition-\\nally. The German troops immediately marched into northern Italy and rescued Mussolini,\\nwho set up his government under German protection.\\nOn the Eastern front, the Soviet Red Army forced Hitler’s army to retreat along the\\nroute on which they had set out so confidently two and a half years before.\\n122\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE INTER-WAR PERIOD AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR\\nMost of the  East European countries–Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,\\nand Hungary–were liberated. The fascists were also driven out of Greece, Yugosla-\\nvia and Albania.\\nIn June 1944, the Allies opened the Second Front in Western Europe. On\\nJune 6–D- Day–the first of the Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy in the\\nNorth coast of France. The landings had been planned in total secrecy and they took the\\nGermans by surprise. Commanded by General Eisenhower, they broke through the\\nGerman line of defence an liberated Brussels, Paris and Luxemburg by September.\\nSurrender By the fascist powers\\nBy the spring of 1945, the end of war was in sight. The allied troops had taken over\\nmany cities in Italy. In April, there was an uprising in Fascist occupied areas. On\\nApril 28, Mussolini was captured and executed, thus putting an end to fascism in Italy.\\nThe downfall of Germany was now certain. The Allied troop entered Germany from\\nthree directions – the south, the northwest and the east and as the Soviet army reached\\nBerlin, Hitler committed suicide. On May 7, Germany surrendered unconditionally.\\nThe  fall of Japan\\nThe war in Asia and the Pacific continued even after Germany’s surrender.

During the\\nWar the two countries were on the same side with Britain and France to defeat the\\nFascist dictatorships (Germany and Italy) and the empire of Japan. The two countries also\\nsigned a five-year non-aggression treaty in 1941, and even as late as the Yalta Conference\\nin February 1945 there was some harmony among the two countries. But soon the situa-\\ntion changed completely and the USA and the Soviet Union stood against each other in a\\n“war like situation” which has generally been described as the Cold War.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying the lesson, you will be able to:\\n \\ndescribe the meaning of the Cold War\\n \\ndiscuss the factors responsible for the Cold War\\n \\npoint out different issues of struggle\\n \\nlist the phases of the Cold War and\\n \\ncompare the Cold War with New Cold War.\\n25.1 MEANING OF THE COLD WAR\\nThe Cold War has been described as “peace time unarmed warfare” between new\\nsuperpowers. It was a “diplomatic war” and not an armed conflict among the super-\\npowers and was based on ideological hatred and political distrust. Flemming described\\nthe Cold War as “a war that is fought not in the battlefield, but in the minds of men;\\none tries to control the mind of others.” The Cold War was very different from an\\nopen war where the enemies are well known and the war is fought in the open. In the\\nCold War, war was never declared and diplomatic relations were maintained among\\nthe countries. The Cold War did involve some military confrontation and loss of life,\\nbut it was also a psychological warfare aimed at reducing the enemy’s area of influ-\\nence and increasing the number of one’s camp followers.\\nThe Cold War was a bi-polar confrontation between the United States of America\\nand the Soviet Union but it also involved allies or satellites of the two superpowers.\\nThe Cold War has also been understood as the clash between two ideologies and two\\n128\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\ndifferently organised systems of economy and society-communism and liberal democ-\\nracy, and socialist command economy and capitalism. Although there have been many\\nbi-polar confrontations in history, this was the first time that two different forms of\\nsocial organisation were competing for implementing alternative visions of the world.\\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century both the USA and the USSR were on their\\nway to becoming superpowers. A comparison of the share of various countries in\\nmanufacturing in 1932, just after the Great Depression shows America the indisput-\\nable leader with nearly 32%, and the Soviet Union which came next with 11.5%. But\\nother leading countries were not far behind-Britain (10.9%), Germany (10.6%), France\\n(6.9%). After the Second World War, however, the armed strength of Germany and\\nJapan stood defeated and of Britain and France stood exhausted. Now it was the two\\ncountries-America and Soviet Union-which emerged as superpowers. Soviet Union,\\ndespite phenomenal losses in war made rapid strides because of its socialist com-\\nmand economy. The phenomenal rise of these two countries led to a competition\\nbetween the two which ultimately resulted in the Cold War.\\nThe Soviet Union set up the Cominform (the Communist Information Bureau) , ‘Ra-\\ndio Moscow’ and supported some communist parties in other countries. The United\\nStates of America set up a Radio News programme called ‘Voice of America’ and\\nsupported the anti-communist political parties and movements in other countries.\\nThe conflict between the two countries turned out to be the conflict between differ-\\nent ideologies that both the countries adopted. One of these ideologies was political\\nand economic liberalism which was adopted by America and the other was Marxism-\\nLeninism adopted by Russia.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 25.1\\n1.\\nWhich two ideologies clashed in the cold war?\\n2.\\nWhich were the news services set up by the USA and the USSR?\\n25.2 FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLD WAR\\nAfter World War II, the USA and the USSR, the new superpowers, wanted to estab-\\nlish the supremacy of their position and ideology, and this conflict became the focal\\npoint of international relations. There was formation of opposing blocs, intensifying\\nthe rivalry of these two powers. Most western countries tended to side with the USA\\nand were firmly opposed to communism. America’s rise to the status of superpower\\nwas complete with the possession of the nuclear weapons. Very soon Russia emerged\\nas a challenger and rival to America’s position and in 1949 she also developed nuclear\\nweapons and ended the American supremacy.\\nThere had been a long period of suspicion and distrust between the Soviet Union and\\nthe western countries. The Soviet Union could never forget that Western states\\n129\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\n(Britain, France and the USA) had tried to undo the Bolshevik revolution and inter-\\nvened (along with Japan) in the civil war. The western countries also did not forget\\nthat the declared objective of the Soviet Union was the overthrowing of capitalism\\nworldwide. During World War II, mutual suspicion increased further. After Germany\\ninvaded the USSR in 1941, the Western democracies delayed opening a second front\\nagainst Germany. Britain and the USA promised that they would do so, but the delay\\nconfirmed the Soviet suspicion that the west wanted a prolonged struggle between\\nGermany and Russia so that both would be eliminated.\\nDuring the war, both the sides encouraged opposite elements in the countries liber-\\nated from the Axis powers (Germany, Italy and a few smaller states). After the\\nfascist dictator Mussolini was removed from power in Italy, Italy was supported by\\nthe Western powers and received ‘aid for reconstruction’ (grants of money totaling\\nhundreds of millions of USA dollars). Since Italy had one of the largest communist\\nparties outside of the USSR, USSR leaders saw this as an attempt to strengthen the\\ncapitalist camp or bloc of countries. There were similar problems in Greece and\\nPoland. The USA helped defeat communist forces in Greece.\\nAfter 1945, both superpowers took some steps to lessen mutual suspicion. The USA\\nagreed to occupy only the western zones of Germany and Austria and to stay out of\\nPoland, Czechoslovakia and other eastern European territories that had been liberated by\\nthe Soviet Red Army. The Soviet Union dissolved the Comintern (Communist Information\\nBureau) and allowed capitalist forces to control Greece. The Soviet Union in 1952 va-\\ncated Finland and by 1955 had removed all its troops from Austria. There remained\\ndifferences of opinion between the USA and USSR regarding the future of Europe and\\nother areas. Soviet Union wanted to install ‘friendly’ governments in the East European\\ncountries liberated from the Nazi Germany. By friendly governments, the Soviet Union\\nmeant the communist governments, with which America and Britain did not agree. The\\nSoviet Union also tried to establish her domination in Turkey and delayed the withdrawal\\nof her troops from Iran, much to the dislike of the western countries.\\nBoth sides were responsible for the Cold War. The temporary truce between the two\\nparties during the World War II was just a bright patch in the otherwise strained\\nrelationship between the two, before and after the war.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 25.2\\n1.\\nWhich countries formed the part of the Axis power?\\n2.\\nWhich countries formed the part of the Allies power?\\n3.\\nWhich parts of Europe were influenced by the USA and the USSR?\\n25.3 DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE COLD WAR\\nIt is very difficult to find an exact date for the start of the Cold War since the war was\\nnever declared and even the undeclared aggression was of a long-term kind. After\\n130\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\nthe initial phase (1945-47) which has been called the ossification phase, the Cold War\\nbegan in earnest and at its centre was the creation of a European postwar order. The\\nonset of the Cold War reflected the failure of the different powers to consistently\\nrespect the principles agreed on at wartime conferences of Yalta and Potsdam.\\nFirst Phase\\nIn the early phase the fate of Poland turned out to be a crucial issue. All the countries\\nhad a special interest in Poland. France and Britain had declared war on Germany\\nwhen Hitler’s army had crossed the Polish border in September 1939. For Russia,\\nPoland had been a historic enemy: on the other hand Polish lands had been the\\ntraditional gateway for invasion of Russia from the west. When the Soviets entered\\nPoland in 1944, they formally handed over power to the Lublin government, pro-\\ncommunist committee of National liberation. The future of Poland was discussed at\\nlength at the Yalta Conference of Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt. No agreement\\ncould be reached on the exact boundary of Poland. But Poland ultimately came into\\nthe Soviet camp. The sovietisation of Poland became a landmark in the origin of the\\nCold War.\\nThe second crucial area of conflict was the Balkan. Britain and the Soviet Union had\\ndecided to have their own spheres of influence in the Balkan areas. But in all the\\ncountries except Greece communist regimes were installed, and once the communist\\ngovernments were installed they were openly supported by the Soviet Union. Except\\nGreece, which came under British control, all other East European countries fell under\\nSoviet domination. Churchill’s formulation of this state of affairs was that an ‘iron cur-\\ntain’ had descended over Europe. This led to an intensely strained relationship between\\nthe East and the West, including between the USA and the Soviet Union.\\nAfter the unconditional surrender to the Allied forces, Germany was divided into\\nfour occupation zones-each one under the control of the Soviet Union, the USA,\\nBritain and France. Berlin, the capital of Germany, fell in Soviet occupation zone but\\nBerlin itself was divided into four occupation zones on the same pattern as the whole\\nof Germany. The military occupation was a temporary arrangement till the time the\\nPeace Treaty was concluded. The Potsdam Conference was convened to finalise the\\npeace treaty with Germany. The Allies were not clear on critical issues, such as\\nwhether Germany should be disarmed, demilitarised and partitioned. To what degree\\nwas the reconstruction of the German industry to be allowed? The Soviet Union\\nwanted a pauperised and weak Germany so that its interests did not get threatened by\\nGermany. The Soviet Union also demanded US$ 20 billion from Germany as repara-\\ntion fees. But the western allies did not agree to these proposals. Later the British,\\nAmerican and French zones were merged into one and Federal Republic of Germany\\n(West Germany) came into existence. After the election in the new state a pro-west\\ngovernment came to power. It started getting heavy financial aid from America.\\nSoon, with the Soviet help the other zone also created a state called German\\nDemocratic Republic (East Germany).\\nThe western allies wanted to introduce monetary reforms in Germany, but the Soviet\\nUnion did not and responded by what is known as the Berlin Blockade. The Soviet\\nUnion imposed a total ban on all traffic between Berlin and the western zones, be it\\nroad, rail or waterways. This Blockade was also in protest against the Brussels\\nPact which was formulated as a mutual defense treaty between Britain, France and\\nBelgium. The Pact directed the signatories to extend military assistance to any\\n131\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE COLD WAR ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\n member state in case of attack by Germany or any third party in Europe. Though the\\nname of the Soviet Union was not mentioned in the text it was mainly aimed against\\nthe Soviet Union and not against Germany.\\nIn Iran a crisis developed when Soviet troops failed to withdraw by March 1946. Iran\\nhad been the main thoroughfare for western aid to the Soviet Union during the war.\\nIran was also rich in oil. The Soviet Union demanded privileged access to Iranian oil\\nand refused to allow Iranian troops in the Soviet held areas. US then mounted pres-\\nsure in the United Nations Security Council forcing the Soviet forces to leave Iran.\\nMap 25.The Confrontation between the Superpowers-1950\\nEast\\nW\\nest\\nWarsaw\\nPO\\n132\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\nIn Turkey, the Soviet Union demanded the internationalisation of the Bosporus Strait.\\nThe western allies resisted that. In Greece, the USA and the Soviet Union backed\\nrival factions. The Greek conservative forces had called upon the USA for support.\\nIt was in this backdrop that the US President Truman formulated his policy which\\ncame to be known as Truman doctrine. The Truman doctrine was a policy of ‘con-\\ntainment’ i.e., to limit or contain communism to areas where it had already triumphed,\\nbut to not let it spread any further. Thus, the American foreign policy changed from\\none of isolationism to become interventionist. This intervention was aimed at contain-\\ning the spread of communism anywhere in the world.\\nThere was a significant rise of communism in some of the western European coun-\\ntries also. The war-torn countries of Europe had hoped for improvement in their lot\\nafter the war but that did not happen. European national economies and industries\\nwere struggling and the members of the communist parties in these countries were\\nincreasing. It was in this background that U.S. Secretary of State, Marshall, put\\nforward his plan for European economic reconstruction which is known as ‘The\\nMarshall Plan’. The Plan envisaged American transfer of more than ten billion\\ndollars to Europe over a period of twenty years. It was hoped that such massive\\nmonetary infusion would help Europe recuperate from the ravages of the war and\\nthus stabilize its material condition and political climate. It was also believed that only\\na stable Europe would be able to resist the indigenous and external communist chal-\\nlenges. Significantly, the offer of aid was made to East European countries also.\\nOn its part the Soviet Union revived the ‘Cominform’ (Communist Information Bu-\\nreau) in response to the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. It was founded with\\nthe intention to bring the communist governments in the Soviet sphere of influence in\\nline with Moscow’s policies. Thus, it was an attempt to further consolidate Commu-\\nnism in Eastern Europe.\\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was signed on April 4, 1949. This treaty\\nwas signed in pursuance of the policy of “containment”. It was between the US and\\nother European countries–Britain, France, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Italy,\\nthe Netherlands, Luxemburg, Norway and Portugal. The treaty was a military alli-\\nance against the Soviet Bloc. Article V of the NATO treaty is the central provisio\\nwhich states that an attack on any member of NATO would be considered as an act\\nof aggression against all others. However, every member state had the right to decide\\non the kind of support it wanted to offer to other member states. Later, Greece and\\nWest Germany also joined the NATO.\\nPost-1945 developments in China and Korea led to the intensification of the Cold\\nWar. In China, the Communists gained power in 1949 under Mao Tse-Tung and\\nPeople’s Republic of China was established (See Unit 5.5.7). The United States\\nrefused to recognise the People’s Republic of China, which was also denied entry\\ninto the United Nations; only Taiwan (‘Nationalist’ China) was recognized. The United\\nStates used its power of veto to keep communist China out of the U.N. and the Soviet\\nUnion effectively boycotted the U.N. because of this. However, this did not mean the\\nestablishment of friendly relations between the USSR and PRC: after 1950 their\\nrelations took a turn for the worse.\\nAfter the defeat of Japan in the World War II, Korea was divided into North Korea\\nunder Soviet control and South Korea under American control in accordance with the\\nPotsdam Conference. South Korea was effectively a dictatorship with direct support\\n133\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\nfrom the USA. In North Korea a pro-Soviet Government was set up. Neither the\\nSoviet Union nor the U.S.A. recognised the governments which were opposed to\\nthem. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, whose per-\\nmanent Security Council was dominated by capitalist states, declared North Korea\\nthe aggressor and set up a unified UN command to repel the North Korean attack.\\nGeneral MacArthur of the USA was named its commander. The UN troops pushed\\nNorth Korean forces out of South Korea and entered deep into the North Korean\\nterritory, reaching the Chinese border. China then joined the North Korean troops to\\npush the UN troops into South Korea. Ultimately an armistice was signed in 1953\\nbringing to an end the threat of an open war. The Korean crisis was the first military\\nstruggle of the Cold War. The USA and USSR and PRC did not engage in much\\ndirect combat with one another (although North Korean aircrafts were actually flown\\nby Soviet pilots) but they fought each others’ client powers (the Republic of Korea\\nand the Democratic Republic of Korea: neither was actually a democracy!).\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 25.3\\n1.\\nWhich countries future was discussed at Yalta conferences?\\n2.\\nWhich leader coined the famous term “Iron Curtain”?\\n3.\\nWhat was the aim of the Truman Doctrine?\\n4.\\nWhat does NATO stand for?\\n25.4 SECOND PHASE OF THE COLD WAR : POST\\nTRUMAN-STALIN ERA\\n In the second phase, tensions eased considerably but there was no end to the Cold\\nWar. In both the countries, there was a leadership change at the highest level. In the\\nUSA President Truman’s tenure came to an end in 1953 and in the Soviet Union\\nStalin died in 1953. Stalin was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who retreated on\\nmany of the policies of Stalin. On the policy front, Khrushchev stood for the policy of\\nrelaxation of tension in Europe and admitted Soviet responsibility for some problems\\nthere. On the other hand, he openly suppressed anti-Soviet leaders and ideas in Po-\\nland and Hungary and denounced as ‘fascist’ the activities of liberals and Catholics\\nwho expressed Polish and Hungarian nationalism. Soviet leaders during this period\\nalso commented critically on racial conflicts in the USA, which they said were inevi-\\ntable consequences of capitalist inequality. For its part, the USA and its clients tried to\\nstir up anti-Soviet feelings in the East European countries.\\nThe change of leaders in the USSR and Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalinism\\ninspired revolts in Poland and Hungry. In 1956, revolt broke out in Poznan city of\\nPoland but was suppressed. The Communist Party of Poland became divided into\\n134\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\ntwo factions, one Stalinist and the other owing allegiance to Gomulka. Gomulka’s\\nfaction succeeded and the Communist Party of Poland decided to pursue a “national\\nroad to socialism”. This meant that Poland would have more control over its affairs\\nas long as it respected Soviet hegemony (for instance, in economic and military af-\\nfairs) throughout Eastern Europe. Thus, Poland became the second country after\\nYugoslavia to follow the path of  “Nationalist Communism”, which most Soviet lead-\\ners accepted within limits.\\nIn Hungary people rose in revolt in 1956. The Soviet Union initially agreed to some\\nreform, but when Hungarians demanded complete withdrawal of the Soviet troops\\nand Hungary’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact (which was set up by the Soviet\\nUnion in response to NATO), the Soviet leadership got annoyed with the ‘New Course’.\\nThe final declaration of Hungary’s neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact\\nled to the execution of Imre Nagy, the then ruler of Hungary and the attack on\\nHungary by the Soviet Union. Thus the Soviet Union made it clear that it was not\\nready to accept a liberalised communist regime or a multiparty democracy in Poland.\\nThe US did not do much about it as any action on its part would probably have led to\\ndirect confrontation between the Soviet Union and the USA.\\nAfter the Chinese Revolution, General Chiang Kai-Shek led his followers across the\\nTaiwan Strait and set up the Republic of China which continued to represent China in\\nthe UN till 1971. The American policy before 1950 was not to interfere in Taiwan in\\nthe event of attack by the Communist China (Peoples’ Republic of China). But after\\nthe Korean War in 1950, the U.S. policy changed and after 1953 US President\\nEisenhower agreed to massive American rearmament of Taiwan.\\nIn 1954, the PRC (China) declared that Taiwan had to be liberated and accordingly\\nstarted military operations. The US on its part threatened to use nuclear weapons and\\nwar between the PRC and the US seemed imminent. Communist China showed an\\ninclination to back down and the NATO states declared they would not support Ameri-\\ncan use of nuclear weapons. During this period the PRC leaders believed that the\\nadvances made by the USSR in the development of long range delivery systems for\\nnuclear weapons, ICBMs, had tilted the European balance of power in favour of the\\nEastern bloc. PRC leaders were not sure what USSR military resurgence would\\nmean for them; perhaps it would make the USA less likely to threaten the PRC.\\nWhen the PRC bombarded Quemoy in 1957, it was the USSR that pressured the\\nPRC to stop. Ultimately direct Sino-USA war was avoided, but Chinese Communist\\nsuspicion of the USA and USSR increased.\\nThe Suez Canal was constructed in the mid 19th c. by the British and the French.\\nThe Suez Canal Company enjoyed the right to operate the canal and earn profits for\\na period of 99 years commencing 1869. The Egyptian decision to nationalise the Suez\\nCanal–that is, make it part of Egyptian national territory–in 1956 led to a series of\\ncrises. Britain, France and Israel decided to initiate a concerted military campaign\\nagainst Egypt. America was against the use of force. But Israel attacked Egypt in\\ncollusion with Britain and France. This forced the USA to condemn its own allies and\\nfor the first time since the Cold War, the USA and the Soviet Union came together on\\nthis issue. Britain and France had to accept a UN peace keeping force for the canal.\\nThe imperial decline of France, which had tried to remain independent of the USA\\nsecurity bloc, speeded up after the ‘Suez Crisis’. Britain too was now generally rec-\\nognized as being only a second-rate power and junior partner of the USA.\\n135\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\nIn Cuba Fidel Castro came to power after many years of struggle in 1959. He brought\\nCuba closer to the Soviet Union within a few years. The USA cut off diplomatic\\nrelations with Cuba, refused to purchase Cuban sugar and supported an ‘invasion’ of\\nCuba in 1961 by anti-Castro Cubans who were living in exile in the USA. The exiles\\nattempted a landing at the Bay of Pigs. The ‘invasion’ turned out to be a complete\\nfailure as the exiles got no support from the people of Cuba. The Soviet Union then\\ndecided to install a nuclear bomber and ground-to-ground missiles in Cuba (some of\\nthem only 150 km. from the USA). The Soviet Union also dispatched dozens of long-\\nrange missiles to Cuba. (Since 1949, the USA had put bomber and missile bases in\\nNorway, Turkey and other places directly adjacent to the USSR.) The USA in turn\\nannounced a blockade of Cuba. There was a strong possibility of war between the\\nsuperpowers. Initially the Soviet Union denounced the blockade but later agreed to\\nwithdraw the missiles on the condition that the Americans would not invade Cuba and\\nwould remove their medium-range nuclear missiles from Turkey. The USA agreed to\\nthe first condition; they soon removed missiles from Turkey with the excuse that they\\nwere outdated. This was probably the closest the superpowers came to nuclear war\\nduring the Cold War.\\nThe Soviet Union virtually gave an ultimatum to the western powers demanding\\ndemilitarisation of all of Berlin within six months; the USSR would remove its occu-\\npation troops if the other occupiers did the same. If agreement was not reached\\nwithin six months, the Soviet Union was to transfer its occupation rights in East Berlin\\nto the German Democratic Republic (‘East Germany’). When Soviet troops sur-\\nrounded the city, the West Berliners and foreign occupiers were supplied by an ‘air-\\nbridge’; eventually Soviet leaders decided they could not easily force the Western\\npowers out of Berlin, the city they had lost 300,000 troops in occupying at the end of\\nthe Second World War. The ‘Berlin Crisis’ was not so much defused as won in\\nfavor of the Western occupation forces.\\nThe Soviet Union continued to be worried during the 1950s by the flight of many\\nworkers and professionals from East Germany to West Germany via Berlin. When\\nthey resumed pressure against the Western occupiers over the Berlin question, the\\nlatter changed some of the terms of occupation to prevent being drawn into a major\\nconflict over Germany. West Germany, the German Federal Republic, was being re-\\narmed after 1955 and given effective control over most of the western occupation\\nzones, where the communists were outlawed for some time. In 1961 the Soviet occu-\\npiers of East Berlin built a concrete wall to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the\\nWest German state. The Berlin Wall became a symbol of Cold War politics until\\nGermans tore it down in 1989–90.\\nDuring the second phase of the Cold War, there was a thaw between the two super-\\npowers but on certain occasions, as during the Cuban Missile crisis in 1962, the\\ntension ran very high. The possibility of a nuclear war and its catastrophic effects\\nwas an important factor that forced the two superpowers to change their attitudes. In\\nboth the countries there were pressures to reduce military expenditures.\\nSome grounds for improved relationship between the two superpowers had already\\nbeen made. In 1963 the Soviet Union, the USA and Britain had signed a nuclear test ban\\ntreaty and agreed to carry out their nuclear tests underground only to avoid polluting the\\natmosphere any further. In the same year a telephonic link (the so called hot line) was\\nintroduced between Moscow and Washington to ensure swift consultations.\\n136\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 25.4\\n1.\\nWhich Soviet leader initiated the policy of relaxation of tension on Europe and\\nsuppression of anti-soviet leaders and ideas at the same time?\\n2.\\nWhat does PRC stand for?\\n3.\\nWhen did Berlin wall collapse?\\n25.5 THE DETENTE\\nThe Soviet Union and the USA relationship now entered a new phase which has been\\ndescribed as Detente, a term that was used for relaxation in East-West conflict. The\\nDetente was also to take into account China. The relationship between the USA and\\nChina had been tense for past few years. The Detente with China was a notable\\nachievement. The Cold War did not end during this period but there were improved\\nlevels of understanding. Henry Kissinger, an American official, described Detente as\\n“a mode of arrangement of adversary power”. Leonid Brezhnev, who succeeded\\nKhrushchev as Soviet leader after the Cuban missile crisis, described Detente as\\n“willingness to resolve differences and disputes not by force, not by threats and saber\\nrattling, but by peaceful means at the conference table. It also means a certain trust\\nand ability to consider each other’s legitimate interests.” President Nixon of the USA\\nhas been described as the “author of Detente”. But this is more appropriate in the\\ncontext of U.S.-China relations. Although Nixon had based his political career during\\nthe 1940s-60’s as an anti-communist ‘hardliner’, when elected President in 1968 he\\ntook steps to improve US relations with China.\\nSeveral steps were taken by both the countries to ease the tension. In 1968, a nuclear\\nnon-proliferation treaty (NPT) was signed by U.K., USA and USSR. A major area of\\nconflict between the two superpowers was the two Germanys and Berlin. In 1969,\\nthe government of West Germany initiated the policy of Ostpolitik which means a\\n“policy for the East”. West Germany renewed normal relations with East European\\ncountries. Both the Germanys recognised each other and were recognised as sepa-\\nrate and legitimate states by the superpowers; the two Germanys joined the United\\nNations in 1973. In 1972 USA and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms\\nLimitation Treaty (SALT-I). The agreement did not reduce the amount of arma-\\nments but did slow down the arms race. The then Presidents of the Soviet Union and\\nthe USA met thrice (Brezhnev and Nixon respectively). The USA also started ex-\\nporting wheat to the Soviet Union. In July 1975, 35 countries assembled for the\\nHelsinki (Finland) Conference. The signing of its final act was regarded, for the\\ntime being, as burying the Cold War. The final act contained ten principles, most\\nimportant of which was that all the Nations were to accept the European frontier\\nwhich had been drawn after the Second World War. Thus the division of Germany\\nwas accepted. The communist countries promised to allow their peoples “human\\nrights” including freedom of speech and freedom to leave the country.\\n137\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\nDuring the period of detente USA-China relations improved considerably. President\\nNixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made special efforts to ease the ten-\\nsion with China. In 1971, China was admitted to the UN and Taiwan was expelled. In\\n1978 the USA withdrew the recognition of Nationalist China and in 1979 the USA\\ngave recognition the People’s Republic of China, and ambassadors were exchanged.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 25.5\\n1.\\nWhat was Detente?

Relations\\nbetween the USA and the Soviet Union became so sore that by 1980 it appeared that\\nCold War had come back. The new tensions came to be described as the New Cold\\nWar. The New Cold War was different from the Cold War in the sense that it was not\\nbased on ideological conflict but on balance of power. In the New Cold War a new\\npower bloc, namely the PRC, emerged as a power that could not be defeated or\\nignored. The intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan in 1979 was the turning\\npoint. The New Cold War was marked by the efforts of both the countries to spread\\ntheir influence mainly outside Europe. Conflicts outside Europe assumed greater sig-\\nnificance than ever before. Detente for the Soviet Union meant acceptance of status\\nquo in Europe only. In Indo-China, Africa, Afghanistan etc. both the countries sup-\\nported opposing groups. The Soviet Union replaced the President of Afghanistan by\\none favourable to it. Nearly 1, 00,000 Soviet soldiers were stationed in Afghanistan.\\nAmerica regarded the positioning of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan as a threat to Iran\\nand moved her warships in the Gulf. Both the countries were deeply involved in\\ndeveloping the new weapons of destruction. The US President, Ronald Reagan,\\napproved of the plan to develop a new weapons system, the Strategic Defence\\nInitiative (SDI) which was also known as Star Wars.\\n25.7 THE END OF THE COLD WAR\\nThe New Cold War came to an end with the collapse of communism in various\\nEast European countries. The pace of collapse was very fast and ultimately commu-\\nnism collapsed in its birth place i.e., the USSR. The process began in Poland in 1988\\nwhen the Solidarity trade union organised huge anti-government strikes forcing the\\ngovernment to allow free elections in which the communists were comprehensively\\n138\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE COLD WAR  ERA AND ITS POLITICS\\ndefeated. The same happened in Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia.\\nIn East Germany the communist leader Eric Honecker wanted to disperse the dem-\\nonstrators by force but was overruled by his colleagues. By the end of 1989, the\\nCommunist Government had to resign in East Germany and the Berlin Wall, the\\nsymbol of Cold War, was pulled down in 1989 with much public enthusiasm. The fall\\nof the Berlin wall was taken to be the end of the Cold War as its erection had been\\ntaken as the start of the Cold War. In 1990 the West German currency was intro-\\nduced in East Germany and finally the two Germanys were reunited. The Chancellor\\nof Federal Republic of Germany was chosen as the head of the Government of the\\nunited country which adopted market economy and western type of democracy.\\nIn the Soviet Union also communism collapsed. Mikhail Gorbachev made efforts to transform\\nand revitalize the country by his policies of glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructur-\\ning-which meant economic and social reforms). But the measures did not succeed and by the\\nend of 1991 the USSR split into separate republics, and Russia alone was not in a position to\\ncommand the same influence that the old Soviet Union did. The Cold War came to an end.\\nMany political commentator argued that with the end of the Cold War the world problems\\nwould disappear but new problems and new areas of conflict have now emerged.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 25.6\\n1.\\nWhat was SDI?\\n2.\\nWhat was glasnost and perestroika?\\n3.\\nWhich symbol symbolized the end of the Cold War?\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nThe Cold War started immediately after the Second World War, though signs of it had\\nstarted appearing during the war. In the early phase of the Cold War, there were at-\\ntempts by the USA and the USSR to spread their areas of influence and ideology. There\\nwas suspicion and distrust against each other. During the second phase there was some\\nrelaxation in the tension between the two countries. The suspicion and distrust, how-\\never, persisted. Immediately after the Detente, a New Cold War started. A new power\\nbloc i.e. the PRC emerged during this period.

Between 1945 and 1980,\\nnearly all the parts of Asia, Africa, Oceana (islands in the western Pacific Ocean)\\nand the Caribbean that had been under European, Japanese and American rule won\\nfreedom and organized themselves into new, independent nation-states.\\nDuring the Second World War (1939-1945), the imperialist and expansionist goals of\\nthe defeated powers, Germany and Japan, were thwarted. Even the victorious colo-\\nnial powers, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands, were unable to keep their\\nimperial commitments, and their leaders faced growing pressure to ‘decolonise’– not\\nonly from their colonial subjects and national citizens but also from the two new\\n‘superpowers’, the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. Most of West Africa, the Philippines\\n(an Asian colony of the U.S.A.) and some other places achieved independence with-\\nout much violence after 1945. In Algeria, Indochina, Malaya, Angola, Mozambique\\nand other places only years of armed struggle by freedom movements led to national\\nindependence.\\nPolitical independence did not immediately bring all the benefits colonised people had\\ndreamed of. New states faced problems of economic development and modernisation\\nthat they needed to solve in order to resist ‘neocolonialism’. Standards of living in\\nmost of the new independent states did not match those of the ‘developed’ countries\\nof Western Europe and North America, and many people today argue that forms of\\ncolonial domination or old patterns of exploitation still remain in the world of formally\\nindependent nation-states.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying the lesson, you will be able to:\\n•\\nlearn about some national freedom movements;\\n•\\nanalyse global political forces affecting the decolonisation process;\\n•\\ndiscuss relationships of dependency and inequality in the post-colonial world and\\n•\\nidentify some of the problems of national development and some proposed\\nsolutions.\\n143\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\n26.1 MODELS OF NATIONAL LIBERATION AND NATIONAL\\nDEVELOPMENT. BEGINNINGS OF DECOLONISATION\\nModels\\nLeaders of national liberation struggles of the twentieth century were inspired by\\nearlier examples of national liberation and development which had introduced the\\nmodern idea of citizenship–that all members of a nation should enjoy equal rights and\\nresponsibilities.\\nThe American war of independence was followed by the emergence of stable, demo-\\ncratic governing institutions in the new United States of America, and the gradual\\nextension of rights of full citizenship to all members of the American nation. Also, the\\nAmerican military remained small and did not often interfere with the working of civil\\ninstitutions. This was very attractive to people in colonies in Asia and Africa where\\nthe military was regularly used to control the population.\\nThe French revolution in 1789 did not begin as a struggle against a foreign power, but\\nthe revolutionaries launched a campaign to spread ‘universal principles’ of Liberty,\\nEquality and Fraternity to other parts of Europe. The French revolution inspired people\\nin Europe and in the French colonies to revolt against French domination–in the\\nname of these principles. Not all of these national revolutionaries believed deeply in\\ndemocracy or equality, but most believed that ‘the people’ needed to be mobilised to\\nfight against foreign domination.\\nThere were other reasons why people under colonial rule admired the American\\nmodel of national freedom and development. Americans developed the world’s larg-\\nest economy between 1865 and 1950, based on capitalist agriculture, heavy industry\\nand mass consumer spending. Many people around the world believed that the U.S.A.\\nwas sincerely committed to self-governance through democracy on a global scale,\\nand that it would act as a force against colonialism, perhaps by directly assisting\\ncolonial subjects in their national liberation struggles.\\nThe Russian (Bolshevik) Revolution of 1917–1921 had a huge global impact. The\\nBolsheviks argued that different ‘nationalities’ all over the world have a right to inde-\\npendence and to decide their own future. The Russian revolution also presented an\\nalternative model of rapid social and economic ‘development’ different from that of\\nthe capitalist Western states. Many Soviet citizens in 1941 enjoyed a higher material\\nstandard of living than had their grandparents.\\nThe Soviet leaders gave ‘moral’ and material support to people of many politically-\\nand economically-dominated countries and colonies. Marxist theory taught that small\\npeasants and proletarians around the world shared the same interests and needed to\\ncooperate to defeat the bourgeoisie and the imperialists. Some colonial nationalists\\nvisited or studied in the U.S.S.R. in order to learn to organise national freedom struggles.\\nThese included the Vietnamese nationalist Ho Chi Minh, the Chinese nationalist leader\\nChiang Kai-Shek (1887–1975), and Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian National Congress\\nleader who believed in democratic socialism and thought that aspects of the Soviet\\ncommand economy might be imitated by India.\\nBeginnings of decolonization\\nGreat Britain and France were forced to respond to some of the growing agitations\\nfor self-governance and ‘home-rule’. As early as 1867, Britain started granting\\n144\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\neffective home-rule to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Canada,\\nregions where Europeans had settled in large numbers since the 1600s, displacing or\\nkilling the ‘natives’. White, settler colonists in those places were allowed to make\\ndecisions about ‘domestic’ affairs through elected legislatures and parliaments, but\\ntheir relations with other colonies and nation-states were regulated by imperial\\nauthorities in London. After 1910, these colonial states were referred to as Domin-\\nions or a British Commonwealth of co-operative nations. Britain also granted com-\\nmonwealth status to the Union of South Africa (where Europeans were greatly out-\\nnumbered by black Africans, but the latter were not allowed to vote, etc.).\\nLike the British and other Westerners, many French people believed that certain\\n‘races’ and societies–especially their own–were ‘advanced’, whereas others were\\n‘primitive’. They argued that it was the moral duty of the “advanced” societies to\\nguide or teach the more primitive societies. After 1914, small numbers of non-French\\npeople in the French colonies were allowed to participate in governing their societies\\nby voting for or serving on legislative assemblies.\\nBritish, French and Dutch colonial rulers were convinced that people in the colonies\\nwould accept this partial independence for sentimental reasons (e.g., appreciation for\\nEuropean culture) or because they might enjoy economic benefits from continued\\nassociation with the mother country. Many colonies did accept plans of loose federa-\\ntions under European guidance as a first step towards complete national indepen-\\ndence. In some colonies, however, for example India, the nationalists continued to\\nagitate and fight for complete independence.\\nWe should also know that modifications of colonial rule before 1945 did not really\\nweaken the position of European colonists and benefited only small numbers of ‘na-\\ntives’ in the colonies.\\n26.2 IMPACT OF WORLD WAR II ON ANTI-COLONIAL STRUGGLES\\nWorld War II radicalised many people in the colonial world who had earlier been\\nuntouched by national freedom movements. In some cases, military struggles of\\ncolonised people against new invaders (principally, the Japanese) turned against the\\nEuropeans who tried to re-occupy the colonies. Africans and Asians were enlisted in\\ncolonial armies to fight the Germans, Italians and Japanese in far corners of the\\nworld, and they learned that Europeans were not undefeatable ‘lords of the earth’.\\nAbout five million Indian soldiers served in British-led armies during the war. Asian\\nand African soldiers had contact with people from other colonies and with European\\nand American soldiers and civilians. Trained to fight German and Japanese ‘tyranny’,\\nthey presented a new kind of threat to their own colonial rulers. During the 1940s in\\nAsia, Africa and the Caribbean, colonial subjects engaged in strikes and mass demon-\\nstrations despite attacks by police and soldiers (including their own ‘countrymen’).\\nBy 1945 many more colonised people than before the war were insisting on full\\ncitizenship rights and national liberation, and they were more confident about fighting\\nthose who opposed their demands.\\nBefore 1939 African intellectuals, professionals and civil servants had formed the\\nbasis of nationalist movements. However, after 1945 such leaders faced greater pres-\\nsure in their own lands from men and women of the peasant and laboring classes to\\nfight for democratic reforms and independence, and to include stronger demands for\\neconomic equality in their national liberation campaigns.\\n145\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\nIn French Indochina, Ho Chi Minh tried to spread communist ideas during the 1930s.\\nIn 1940-1941, the Japanese expelled the French from Indochina and occupied the\\nregion themselves. Ho formed a ‘national people’s front’ (Viet Minh) to throw them\\nout, and when the French were restored as rulers of Indochina in 1945, with British\\nand American consent, Ho and the Viet Minh continued to fight the French, and\\ngained control over much of Indochina by 1954. In that year Vietnam was partitioned\\ninto two, nominally independent states –the northern territory controlled by Ho and\\nhis allies, and the southern half of Vietnam with a growing American political, military\\nand economic presence. The conflict cost the lives of more than 50,000 Americans\\nand millions of Vietnamese, but the Vietnamese had forced the biggest imperialist\\npower of the world to retreat in 1975.\\nIn India there were mass movements against the British all over the country, under\\nthe leadership of the Congress. There were also independent movements of workers\\nand peasants led by the Communists, and also organizations of youth, students, writ-\\ners, women, lower castes. The British were forced to quit in 1947. Independence\\ncame with partition and the formation of two independent states, India and Pakistan.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 26.1\\n1.\\nName some countries that became independent or semi independent between\\n1867 and 1914.\\n2.\\nHow did the 2nd world war radicalize people in colonized countries?\\n3.\\nName some countries that gained national independence after 1945 through armed\\nstruggle.\\n26.3 COLONIAL NATIONALISM, FREEDOM STRUGGLES AND\\nINTERNATIONAL CO–OPERATION\\nSome colonial nationalist leaders in Asia and Africa after 1945 asked for or received\\nSoviet or American assistance and they hoped for honest negotiations by new interna-\\ntional organisations like the United Nations Organisation (based in the U.S.A. from\\n1945). They also formed regional associations of independent states with similar inter-\\nests of national freedom and development. Such associations included the Organisation\\nfor African Unity (O.A.U.), founded in 1963 to arbitrate conflicts between new states\\nand to pressurise colonial powers to let go of their remaining African dependencies.\\nAnother important development was the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement\\n(N.A.M.), including China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran and Egypt, among other\\nstates. Leaders of twenty-nine states met in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, to condemn\\nimperialism, national aggression, racism and atomic weapons.\\nThe non–aligned movement expressed the need for peaceful cooperation of Third\\nWorld states with one another and with both of the superpowers. Leaders of most\\nparticipating N.A.M. states wanted to find and follow a middle path that was neither\\npurely communist nor purely capitalist: there was much talk between the 1950s and\\n146\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\n1970s of Asian and African ‘paths’ to socialism and democracy. Many of the new\\nstates of Africa fell quickly into dictatorships following independence, like Zaire\\n(a former Belgian colony) under Mobuto Sese Seko (president, 1965–1997) and Uganda\\n(a former British colony) under Idi Amin Dada (1924–2003, deposed 1979).\\nSome leaders of Saharan Africa (such as Egypt and Libya) co-operated with states\\nof the Middle East in economic development matters, and also to force the state of\\nIsrael (formerly British Palestine) to end what they saw as an illegal, semi–colonial\\noccupation of Palestinian lands. This was part of the Pan-Arab movement. Leaders\\nof ‘Black Africa’ through the 1970s and ‘80s continued to pressurise white-minority\\nregimes in Rhodesia and South Africa to end racism and discrimination against blacks;\\nthey gave aid to liberation movements (such as the African National Congress in\\nSouth Africa) outlawed by white–minority governments.\\nNewly independent states faced difficulties of national independence and develop-\\nment during the Cold War era (1945–1991). Leaders who were sympathetic–or at\\nleast not hostile–to communism often won popular support. But they faced resistance\\nwhen they tried to weaken the position of the old colonial ‘native’ elites.\\nIn Indonesia, the freedom-fighter Achmed Sukarno (1901–1970) had founded during\\nthe 1920s a Nationalist Party of Indonesia (similar to the Indian National Congress).\\nSukarno proclaimed Five Principles of national liberation: faith in God, humanitarian-\\nism, national independence, democracy and social justice (the latter implying some\\ncentral economic guidance and redistribution of wealth). Muslims (the majority reli-\\ngious community) agreed to rule by a centralised Indonesian state on the condition\\nthat they preserve some local control, especially in matters of religion. During the\\n1950s, Sukarno also worked with the Chinese-inspired communist people’s move-\\nment, but in 1959 he established a dictatorship, although he recognised the legality of\\nthe communist movement. In 1965 Sukarno’s internal enemies (mainly army\\nofficers) deposed him and clamped down on the Indonesian communists, killing hun-\\ndreds of thousands of them. The U.S.S.R. stood aside as this happened, while the\\nAmericans gave covert support to the army officers. Indonesia remained a military\\ndictatorship until very recently.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 26.2\\nMatch each in the left column with the corresponding meaning or term in the\\nright column.\\n(1)\\nIdi Amin\\n founded 1945\\n(2)\\nSukarno\\n includes India\\n(3)\\nNon-Aligned Movement\\n African dictator\\n(4)\\nUnited Nations Organisation\\nIndonesia\\n26.4 DECOLONISATION AND GLOBAL POLITICS\\nThousands of men and women in the colonies suffered punishments for opposing\\ncolonialism, such as Habib Bourguiba (1903–2000), a leader of the independence\\nmovement in French Tunisia (North Africa), and Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972), the\\n147\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\nchief figure in the Ghanaian independence struggle (in British West Africa). How-\\never, others lived during the interwar years in the homelands of their colonial rulers,\\nwhere they learned political ideas and techniques of organisation. Ho Chi Minh (1894–\\n1969) lived in France between 1918 and 1930, where he helped establish the French\\nCommunist Party, before he returned to French Indochina to fight for Vietnamese\\nindependence. Léopold Sédar Senghor (1906–2001) was a university professor and\\npoet in France before returning to his native West Africa to lead the Democratic Bloc\\nof Senegal; he became the first president of Senegal, 1960-1980.\\nDecolonisation proceeded rapidly after 1945, in some areas with limited violence and\\nloss of life. For example, French West Africa was divided into independent Senegal,\\nMauritania, Mali, Ivory Coast, Guinea and other states after 1958, while British West\\nAfrica was divided into the independent nation-states of Ghana, Sierra Leone and\\nNigeria between 1957 and 1961.\\nThe British imprisoned thousands of Indians during the ‘Quit India’ agitation in 1942,\\nbut the Indian independence struggle thereafter involved less violence between\\nIndians and British. However, millions of South Asians lost their lives or were dis-\\nplaced across borders in the ensuing partition of the subcontinent into India and Paki-\\nstan. Independence of some neighboring regions of the former British Raj occurred\\nwith less violence–in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Burma (now Myanmar).\\nMorocco and Tunisia in North Africa separated peacefully from France during the\\n1950s, but neighboring Algeria gained independence (in 1962) only after an eight-year\\nstruggle in which hundreds of thousands of Algerians and thousands of French died.\\nThe people of present-day Angola and Mozambique (in southern Africa) freed them-\\nselves from Portuguese rule after more than a decade of fighting and heavy loss of\\nlife among Africans and the occupying Portuguese in 1975.\\nPeople of present-day Malaysia fought against Japanese occupation during the Second\\nWorld War; the same Malayan Anti-Japanese People’s Army then resisted\\nre-occupation by the British. Over the next ten years, as many as 100,000 British\\nsoldiers were present in Malaya at one time to fight what British leaders called a ‘com-\\nmunist insurgency’. Britain had to withdraw its forces in 1957 and recognised the Fed-\\neration of Malaysia as a semi-independent member of the British Commonwealth.\\nThe process of decolonisation had much to do with the politics of the Cold War, that\\nis the hostility after 1945 between the two superpower blocs: the ‘First World’ led by\\nthe U.S.A. and supposedly upholding capitalist democracy, and the ‘Second World’\\nsystem represented by the Soviet Union and emerging socialist states like the People’s\\nRepublic of China. Some states of the newly decolonized Third World benefited from\\nclose alliances with either of the two superpowers.\\nAfter the expulsion of the Japanese from Korea in 1945, the northern part of the\\nKorean peninsula fell under the influence of the U.S.S.R. and the People’s Republic\\nof China, while the southern part became a dependency of the U.S.A. The Ameri-\\ncans poured more than ten billion dollars of ‘development assistance’ into South\\nKorea between 1953 and 1970. Economists from the 1970s were calling South Ko-\\nrea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore the ‘Little Dragons’ of Asia–the ‘big drag-\\nons’ being Japan and the People’s Republic of China–because of their rapidly grow-\\ning economies based on production of industrial goods (e.g., steel, ships, electronic\\nequipment) for export.

From the late 1920s, Communists led by Mao Zedong (1893–\\n1976), Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and others fought against the Chinese Nationalists\\n(Guomindang), and both groups tried to expel the Japanese, who exercised territorial\\nand economic control since the 1890s.\\nMao believed that Chinese nationalists were unwilling to bring about social and eco-\\nnomic changes that would emancipate the Chinese masses, and that they were too\\ncorrupt to resist the foreigners. The Chinese Communists therefore not only forced\\nthe Japanese, French and British out of most of the ‘national’ territory by 1949, but\\nalso drove their opponents, the Goumindang, Chinese ‘Nationalists’, to the island of\\nFormosa–present-day Taiwan–across a narrow strait from mainland China . Hong\\nKong was a British Crown Colony until 1997. Their ultimate goal remained to reunify\\nTaiwan with the Chinese mainland, which became a separate state.\\nSince 1945, China has experienced probably the greatest revolution in history, trans-\\nforming itself from a peasant-majority society dominated by native elites (and by the\\nBritish, French, British and Americans who controlled much of the country’s trade),\\ninto a socialist state called the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.). A socialist state\\nmeant state owned industrial enterprises and a policy leading to collectivized agricul-\\nture, with land owned collectively.\\nSince the 1980s, however, the C.C.P. leadership has promoted free enterprise in\\nmanufacturing and commercial activities. By 1993, less than ten percent of P.R.C.\\nindustrial production was under central planning. The P.R.C. since the 1980s has\\nwelcomed hundreds of billions of (U.S.A.) dollars in foreign investment from coun-\\ntries that are China’s ideological opponents.

Chinese leaders\\njustified their military buildup by pointing to the fact that American leaders had consid-\\nered dropping nuclear bombs on the P.R.C. during the Korean War (1950–1953). At the\\nsame time, P.R.C.-U.S.S.R. relations worsened during the 1950s as Mao believed\\nMarxism-Leninism needed to be adjusted to Chinese conditions and he and some other\\nleaders feared Soviet domination. During the 1960s and ‘70s, the Soviets gave military\\nassistance to the Vietnamese communists in their struggle against the U.S.A., but the\\nP.R.C. refused to support the Vietnamese communist movement.

The I.M.F. organises loans to states that do\\nnot earn enough from their exports to ‘balance’ their expenditure on imports. The\\nWorld Bank loans money to states, often as supplement to ‘development assistance’,\\nto pay for irrigation and hydroelectric systems, and other infrastructure improve-\\nments that are supposed to increase productivity and economic security.\\nMany people have however, argued that these institutions have favored the interests\\nof the countries that were already developed. The I.M.F. has required governments\\nreceiving loans to reduce their deficits, which those governments have often had to\\ndo by reducing ‘social spending’ (e.g., funding for health, education, housing). The\\nI.M.F. has also advised governments to devalue their currencies, which has made\\ntheir export products cheaper in the world market.\\nThe permanent Security Council of the U.N.O. after 1945 consisted of the U.S.S.R.,\\nthe U.S.A., Nationalist China (until the 1970s), Great Britain, and France. During the\\n150\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nNATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\nCold War, Britain and France sided with the U.S.A. on about two-thirds of the issues\\nthat came up for vote in the Security Council –reinforcing American preferences and\\ndecisions about world politics, including economic issues.\\nTo some people in Asia, Africa and Latin America, claims by leaders of developed,\\ncapitalist societies about freedom and justice often seemed a sham, and the policies\\ndesigned by them appeared hypocritical. At the same time, wider exposure of people\\naround the world to ‘Western’ capitalist lifestyles–through magazines, cinema and\\ntelevision–has led them to acquiesce to Western (especially American) ways of\\norganising economic and other activity.\\nW. W. Rostow, an American economist believed that former colonies could follow the paths\\ntaken by early industrial states like Britain and by expanding their agricultural production and\\nfollowing free-trade policies, could accumulate the capital to develop industry, and thus move\\ninto economic modernity. This concept of development is known as ‘modernisation theory’.\\nWhile countries like Argentina and later Brazil tried to follow this model and did\\ndevelop some industry, many other Latin American, African and Asian countries\\nshowed signs of ‘development crisis’ between the 1960s and 1980s: stalled\\nindustrialisation, and increasing poverty. Foreign companies in Latin America after\\n1960 took out far more money (as profits) than they had invested there. Loans from\\nprivate banks and bodies like the I.M.F. did not improve the situation: during the\\n1980s, Latin American states had to make loan repayments totaling more than $200\\nbillion (U.S.A. dollars). In the early 1990s, more than sixty percent of Latin American\\nhouseholds did not earn enough to cover basic needs such as food, clothing and\\nshelter. In Africa, the economic situation was still worse: some African states like\\nZaire and Burundi experienced ‘negative growth’ during the 1980s.\\nEconomists and political scientists in Latin America criticised the arguments made by\\neconomists like Rostow and the development policies promoted by some Western\\nleaders. This critique is sometimes called ‘dependency theory’ or ‘underdevelopment\\ntheory’. Raul Prebisch and other ‘dependency theorists’ claimed that centuries of\\nSpanish and Portuguese rule, followed by decades of economic domination by Brit-\\nain, the U.S.A. and other states, had left most Latin Americans unable to exercise\\ntheir freedom, especially with regard to material circumstances like employment and\\nuse of economic resources. Like Prebisch, Walter Rodney in Africa in the 1970s\\nobserved that colonies could not easily pull out of the ‘dependency patterns’ created\\nduring the centuries of colonialism. (See discussion of imperialism in Unit 5.1.) They\\nclaimed that agriculture would remain backward until large landowners ceased ex-\\nploiting the poorer peasants and laborers: large estates (like the zamindari in India)\\nshould be broken up and land redistributed to peasantry.\\nMany successful political leaders in the ‘Third World’, based on experience of Soviet\\nUnion and China, have followed economic development strategies based on state\\nownership or control of enterprises and resources. They have also tried to prevent\\nmass outflows of profits to foreign investors and states, and to lift up the poor through\\nfree education, more affordable health care, and so forth. For example, in Cuba Fidel\\nCastro (1927– ) led a nationalist revolution during the late 1950s, and has been follow-\\ning such policies that favour the interests of the Cuban people. The Castro revolution\\nhas been popular among some Latin Americans who resent continuing foreign influ-\\nence and dictatorships of their countries propped up by the U.S.A. Majority of the\\nCubans enjoy a better standard of living than people in richer countries.\\n151\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\\nOther Latin American leaders after 1960 followed the Cuban example in some re-\\nspects. Salvador Allende was elected president of Chile in 1970 as a socialist. During\\nhis brief rule he tried to ‘nationalise’ the Chilean mineral resources controlled by\\nforeign corporations. However, he was deposed and killed in 1973 by internal\\nenemies with assistance from the U.S.A. and replaced by a dictator (General Pinochet)\\nuntil 1990. More recently, Hugo Chavez (1954– ), an army officer elected president\\nof Venezuela in 1998, has used revenues from state-owned oil companies to lift Ven-\\nezuelans out of poverty. Government spending on social programs was increased\\ndramatically during the first years of his presidency, and he has been able to resist the\\nUS quite effectively.

In this lesson we will carry over the\\ndiscussion into the 20th century, which saw the acceleration and deepening of the\\nsocial processes that characterized the 19th century: some of them quite irreversible\\nand profound in their impact on human life.\\nThe last decades of the 20th century saw the collapse of the socialist societies in\\nEurope and the collapse of the capitalist welfare state as well. It saw increasing\\ninequalities between the capitalist countries and within the capitalist countries. We\\nwill point towards some of these and the differences in social transformation be-\\ntween capitalist and socialist societies as well.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying the lesson, you will be able to:\\n•\\ndiscuss how development of industrialisation to large parts of the world contrib-\\nuted to fundamental changes in society everywhere;\\n•\\nrecognise that there were differences in these processes between the advanced\\ncountries and those that won their freedom from colonialism in the 20th century;\\n•\\nnote some of the social changes over time even within the advanced countries and\\n•\\nidentify the differences between capitalist and socialist countries.\\n27.1 DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES\\nThe pattern of demographic changes noticed in the 19th century continued into the\\n20th century.  In the 1990s the world contained five or six billion human beings, per-\\nhaps three times as many people as at the outbreak of World War I: this is despite an\\nestimated 187 million deaths during the century due to various causes, including\\nnatural deaths.\\n There was a sustained growth in world population throughout the 20th century. In\\nWestern Europe and North America this was mainly due to better health facilities\\nand decline in infant mortality, and expansion of social security systems which al-\\nlowed for longer lives. In Eastern Europe and on the other continents the increase\\nwas because birth rates continued to be high.\\n156\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nSocial Transformation\\nBut from 1930 we find a downward trend in Eastern Europe as well, and by 1960s\\nalmost the whole of Europe had low fertility, but this was offset by low mortality\\nrates. So over all there was growth of population throughout the developed world.\\nHowever, population growth in Europe was negatively effected by the two world\\nwars of the 20th century. This was mainly due to the huge numbers killed, but also\\nbecause of delayed marriages and disruption of family lives.\\nThe developing societies experienced rapid population growth after 1945, at rates\\ngreater than the West. Here better medical facilities became available in the 20th\\ncentury, but at the same time older structures of society dominated by agriculture\\n(where more children meant more family labour and security for parents) meant a\\nmore rapid demographic growth.\\nA comparison therefore shows that at the end of the century what we call the west-\\nern world contained just 1/6 of the world population.\\nDemographic changes involved changes in patterns of human settlements and in distri-\\nbution of population as well. For example, continued migrations remained an important\\nfactor affecting population distribution in the twentieth century.  1901 to 1915 saw the\\nmost intensive out-migration from Europe. Southern and Eastern Europe were espe-\\ncially areas of out migration, north Europe both sent out and received migrants, while\\nwestern Europe received people rather than have them move out. These migration\\npatterns were due to push and pull of labour demand and of political factors. For ex-\\nample, Nazi policies resulted in forced migrations of Jews, minorities and political pris-\\noners from Germany, while post war reconstruction led to migration into Germany of\\nTurkish workers. Civil wars in Russia and Spain similarly resulted in out migrations.\\nThus we can see that population growth and population shifts were a result of many\\nfactors. Today there is a migration to the western world from poorer countries, but\\nmostly of skilled and qualified middle classes, while those who are poor have no\\nchances to migrate there because of strict restrictions by these countries. Some mi-\\ngrations of poorer population do take place to the Middle East, however.\\nSon preference has destroyed the gender balance in countries like India and China,\\nand has become a matter of great concern.\\n27.2 URBANIZATION\\nModern urban life is specifically connected with capitalist industrialization. Urbanization\\nmeans growth of towns and a faster growth of town population as compared with rural\\npopulation. Urbanization is therefore a result of not just natural growth in population, but\\nalso of shift of population from countryside to towns because of industrialization and\\ngreater economic opportunities in towns. You have read something about these pro-\\ncesses in Unit 1. This process was not uniform throughout the world, and not even\\nthroughout Europe, or within a country, and did not come about all of a sudden.\\nThere was a great divergence in rhythm of change between industrial and non-indus-\\ntrial areas, and areas where agriculture had become mechanized and not become mecha-\\nnized. With industrialization most people came to be employed in the production of\\nmanufactured goods and services, both of which were concentrated in towns and cities.\\nIn 1900 UK, the country that industrialized first, was still the most urbanized country\\nwith a 77% urban population, while Germany, which by then had a faster pace of\\n157\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Social Transformation\\nindustrialization, had about 56% living in urban areas. Other countries still had less\\nthan half its people living in urban centres. And if we take the world into account, at\\nthe beginning of this century about 70% of the population still lived in rural areas.\\nDuring the course of the 20th century, with significant shifts in production due to\\nscience and technological changes, we find urbanization becoming more widespread.\\nIn UK and USA, by the mid 1970s more than 95 % of the employed population was\\nengaged in manufacturing and services and less than 5% in agriculture; in Europe\\n(excluding Russia) by mid 1980s more than 70% lived in urban areas; in Japan, more\\nthan 80% were in manufacturing and services and less than 20% in agriculture.\\nIn countries like Russia even in 1917 the majority of its population was linked with\\nvillages, although the 1930s and the latter half of the century saw rapid urbanization.\\nIn many countries of Asia and Africa, including India, agriculture is still a much bigger\\nsector in terms of people engaged in it.\\nUrbanization has meant growth of very large cities of course but also small towns in\\ndeveloping countries like ours. In 1900 there were 16 cities with more than one million\\ninhabitants; in 1950 there were 67; and in 1985 more than 250. In the world as a\\nwhole, by 1980 at least 40% of people lived in cities, and it could well be 50% today.\\nYou can see the trend in our own country: thousands of people come to big cities in\\nsearch of jobs and livelihood. In fact the developing countries have some of the\\nlargest cities in the world: Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Cairo, Shanghai, Nairobi, Seoul,\\nBangkok etc\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 27.1\\n1.\\nIn what way was population growth affected by the two world wars?\\n2.\\nHow did political factors in Germany effect the migration of population?\\n3.\\nWhat do you mean by urbanization?\\n4.\\nName some of the big cities in the developing countries.\\n27.3 MODERN CLASS SOCIETY\\nCapitalist industrialization resulted in the growth of modern class society, by which\\nwe mean that social classes which existed before it were transformed and integrated\\ninto the capitalist economy and society, and two new social classes also emerged, the\\nbourgeoisie and working class. Pre-capitalist societies were dominated by landed\\nwealth and the landed aristocracy. They were crucially affected by capitalist industri-\\nalization, as and when it emerged in different parts of the world. As with changes in\\npopulation and urbanization, changes in social structures were not uniform all over the\\nworld and not sudden.\\nFor much of Europe the 19th century was the crucial period when the landed aristoc-\\nracy found their lives changed. In England they became modern landlords deriving\\n158\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nSocial Transformation\\ntheir wealth from rent in land and other capitalist ventures, such as commerce, mines, rail-\\nways etc. The continental nobilities retained their dominance well into the twentieth century.\\nPeasants continued to be an important component of societies even after capitalist\\nindustrialization, and growth of capitalism in agriculture. However, as the capitalist\\neconomy penetrated their lives, peasantry itself became divided into classes—the\\nrich, the poor and middle peasants—and began to look at property, criminality and\\nstate authority differently. There also emerged a class of landless agricultural labourers.\\nThe absolute numbers of those engaged in agriculture did not decline even in Europe\\ntill the mechanization of agriculture in the 1940s. The relationship with the landlord\\ncontinued to be the crucial aspect of their social and political experience.\\nThe second half of the 20th century has, however, seen the disappearance of the\\npeasantry almost throughout the western world, and a dramatic fall in countries like\\nJapan and South East Asia in general. Only Sub-Saharan Africa, India and China\\ncontinue to have very large peasantries.\\nThe capitulation by many governments of the Third World—particularly in Asia and\\nAfrica - has resulted in agrarian crises and a very desperate situation for the peas-\\nantry in these areas. Landlessness is increasing, and enclaves of corporate agricul-\\nture have meant a shift to export crops. The demand for export crops from advanced\\ncapitalist countries of the west has resulted in decline of food crop production and\\nconsequent decline in food consumption by the majority of the peasantry. This has led\\nto thousands of suicides by farmers, and also movements of the peasantry for support\\nprices, lower costs of inputs, and water and electricity for irrigation. China has been\\nable to integrate its peasantry very well into its political system, but the market re-\\nforms of the last two decades are leading to discontent there as well, as there is a\\ndemand on agricultural land for industrial purposes.\\nThe bourgeoisie emerged as the growing and finally the dominant social class in the\\n20th century. From late 19th century onwards, throughout Western Europe the wealthiest\\nand most influential sections among the bourgeoisie were the capitalists: industrialists,\\nthe factory owners, the bankers and mine owners. The middle class also included\\nshopkeepers, managers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers and those in services.\\nWith the expansion of education there was an expansion of this class. During the 20th\\ncentury it began to include a significant component of lower middle classes who\\nmanned the lower paid rung of services. This section was most insecure and worst\\naffected by the ups and downs in the market, particularly the Depressions in economy.\\nThe formation of the working class, dependent on wage labour, is linked directly\\nwith the growth of capitalist industry. Throughout Europe the working class remained\\nstratified and differentiated well into the 20th century as mechanization did not come\\nall of a sudden and not to all the industries at the same time. Some skilled crafts died\\nout with emergence of big factories, but new skills were required and new skilled\\nworkers were associated with metal working and electrical industries, and later elec-\\ntronics. But at any given period skilled craftsmen, domestic workers, tailors,\\nlaundrymen, print workers, masons and construction workers, post and telegraph\\nworkers, railway men in a variety of jobs, miners, and skilled and unskilled factory\\nworkers co-existed in all cities. Women formed an important component of these\\nworkers, both in terms of their numbers and also through entry into jobs earlier not\\nopen to them.  All this is equally true of the working classes in the colonized world—\\nAsia, Africa, Latin America—and later when they became independent.\\n159\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Social Transformation\\n27.4 CITY AND SOCIAL LIFE\\nThe city and the social life have reflected the strong division of the rich and the poor.\\nThey had different spaces in the city to live in, and the amenities and facilities were\\nquite different. Multistoried apartments, huge stores and shopping malls, parks and\\nboulevards have changed the landscape of most modern cities, but these co-exist\\nwith pollution, bad sewage, slums, one room dwellings shared by two or three families\\nand even homelessness. This continues to be the face of modern cities even today,\\nanywhere in the world. Unemployment has become a dreaded reality.\\n27.5 FAMILY\\nSignificant changes came about in both nuclear and joint families with the penetration\\nof capitalist industrialization. Prior to this economic revolution, the household was\\ncharacterized by the inseparability of family functions and labour, though different\\ntasks may be performed unequally by men and women.\\nWith capitalist industrialisation the family no longer remained the unit of production, though\\nit continued to be one unit in terms of consumption. The growth of manufactures and\\nfactories meant wage labour; each person in the family earned separately. With bourgeois\\nvalues predominating, a man’s wage began to be considered the “family wage” i.e, a\\nwhole family was meant to survive on it, and women’s work ideally was home and nurtur-\\ning of children. This was, however, a middle class value that better off working class\\nfamilies could aspire to, but was hardly the norm for most working class people.\\nWomen of the working class were as much wage workers as men were. In fact many\\nindustries preferred women or children as employees because they could get away\\nwith paying them less. In practice the concept of equal pay for equal work did not apply\\nto women.\\nIn Practices\\nIn the modern world women usually bear the double burden of earning a wage and\\nprimarily doing the domestic work as well. It is a situation all of you must be familiar with.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 27.2\\n1.\\nWhich are the two new classes which emerged with capitalist industrialization?\\n2.\\nWho are the people included in the middle class?\\n3.\\nIn what way did the emergence of big factories affect workers?\\n4.\\nWhat impact did capitalist industrialization have on employment of women?\\n27.6 WOMEN’S EQUALITY AND FEMINISM\\nThe expansion of economy in the twentieth century, along with literacy, opened new\\navenues for women, both of the working class and the middle class. Apart from domes-\\n160\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nSocial Transformation\\ntic service women now worked in shops and offices, and as nurses and school teachers:\\nthese came to be seen as primarily feminine jobs. The two world wars opened new\\npossibilities for women as they manned many jobs left vacant by men mobilized for war.\\nAll this brought a change in the social position and expectations of women.\\nMiddle class women demanded the vote, and the suffragette movements became an\\nimportant aspect of their assertions for equality. The real fillip for women’s emanci-\\npation in the western world came from the rise of labour and socialist movements,\\nwhich spoke for all oppressed, and called for the transformation of the whole society\\nalong lines that would ensure equality for all, including women. Women saw this as\\nmore realistic. Women formed a good percentage of union members and also of\\nsocialist organizations, although they were not so visible in leadership roles. It was not\\neasy for women to assert equality even in these organizations, and demands for equal\\npay came only when women or enlightened socialist leaderships stressed on it.\\nRoza Luxemburg and Beatrice Webb were celebrated socialist leaders, Colette and\\nSelma Lagerlof were important writers, and women were already participating in\\ntennis tournaments like Wimbledon, French and US Open in the early twentieth cen-\\ntury. Women took up journalism and photography as professionals, and became doc-\\ntors and engineers. Soviet Union had a large percentage of women in its mass orga-\\nnizations and in the central parliament, and in scientific establishments.\\nIn Russia the working class movement had a significant component of women, and\\npeasant women were part of the general revolutionary movement. In Russia and in\\nthe anti-colonial movements they found a much more favourable environment for\\nmass participation. In countries like India and China, questions of women’s education,\\nand opposition to backward social practices were part and parcel of the national\\nliberation struggles, and both men and women expressed them very boldly, with the\\nresult that in India and China women won their vote as free citizens along with men.\\nThe same was true for women in Russia after the Russian revolution of 1917.\\nBy 1990 women were or had been heads of government in sixteen states. Their\\nnumbers in the workforce grew dramatically in the Asian, African and Latin Ameri-\\ncan countries. Mauritius is a significant example. In China and in Eastern Europe\\nthere has been almost 100% employment of women.\\nAll this is not to say that women’s battle for equality is over; it is not so anywhere in\\nthe world. The neo-liberal economic policies from the 1990s have led to increase in\\nunemployment. Women have borne the brunt of it all over the world, including in the\\nformer socialist countries. In the Third World countries, women have been pushed\\ninto the unorganized sector, with least protection of worker rights and no guarantee of\\nminimum wage. Domestic service is still a major source of employment for women.\\nIn India female infanticide and female foeticide have increased in the last decade of\\nthe 20th century. Dowry deaths in India, and domestic violence in general have also\\nbeen on the increase all over the world.\\n27.7 CHANGES IN WORK PATTERNS\\nAs and when the factory system developed, work patterns changed. In Europe this\\nwas in the 19th century, but in much of the rest of the world only in the 20th century.\\nThe workplace of the worker became the factory; he/she had to follow set hours of\\nwork; women and children also went out to work and had to follow the rhythm of the\\nfactory; there was an elaborate system of factory discipline, rules and regulations;\\n161\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n Social Transformation\\nand now it was not the worker, but the machine which decided the form and pace of\\nwork. Introduction of new technology sometimes rendered one set of workers redun-\\ndant and therefore caused distress and unemployment; at others times they had to\\nlearn new skills in order to adapt themselves to new machinery.\\nIn the latter part of the century, another set of changes have taken place in work\\npatterns. Some of the big firms in the western countries have found that with comput-\\ners it is possible to work from home and cheaper for them because they need not\\nspend on office maintenance. These changes were presented as benefiting employ-\\nees, but in fact have meant that employees never fully get off the job; they cannot\\nclaim “leave” and other benefits that employees can get because they do not work in\\nan office; and no opportunity to form trade unions or share grievances with other\\nemployees.\\nNew types of software allow employers to more closely monitor the work and work\\ntime of the employee through the computer networks. You would have read in the\\nnewspapers, about the working conditions of the people who work in BPOs and call\\ncentres that are mushrooming in our country today.\\nAnother set of changes has come from what is called out-sourcing. Big trans-national\\ncompanies have found it easier to shift some of their functions to Third World coun-\\ntries, where wages are low, and where they can bully governments to ensure that\\nthose enterprises remain “trouble free” and enjoy tax benefits. This has meant unem-\\nployment for workers in the western countries, and some jobs for people in Third\\nWorld countries, but on extremely unfavourable terms.\\nBig multinational companies have also brought back the era of sweat shops, where\\nthey contract jobs to small enterprises, which means production often takes place at\\nhome. Here the pay scales are lowest and the workers most exploited. This section of\\nworkers has increased in third world countries, with mostly women having to perform\\nthese jobs.\\nINTEXT QUESTION 27.3\\n1.\\nWhat were the new jobs that women took up in the 20th century?\\n2.\\nHow have neo-liberal economic policies of the 1990s affected women?\\n3.\\nHow did the factory system change work patterns?\\n4.\\nExplain the changes brought about by “out – sourcing’?\\n27.8 SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANISATIONS\\nThe range of social and political organizations has expanded phenomenally in the\\ntwentieth century. Apart from political parties and trade unions among various sec-\\ntions of employees, and women’s and students and writers organizations, we now\\n162\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nSocial Transformation\\nhave all kinds of viewpoints and aspirations reflected organizationally: on education,\\npublic health, minority rights, human rights, peace movements, culture, gay rights,\\nenvironment and conservation, credit and self-help groups. Almost no area of life\\nremains unrepresented. Many of these organizations have demands and aspirations\\nthat present a critique of how their societies are organized, and many of them are\\nsupportive of the way things are.\\n27.9 CAPITALISM, SOCIALISM AND INEQUALITY\\nThe technological and scientific achievements of the 20th century made possible great\\nprogress and benefits for mankind Possibilities are there for sustaining the entire world\\npopulation and for improving the standards of life for all people. Yet globalization and\\neconomies of scale have only widened the gaps between the haves and the have-nots.\\nSocialist societies, with all their drawbacks, had been able to create more equal\\nsocieties, without the huge gaps that we see between the rich and the poor in capitalist countries.\\nAfter the collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the capitalist\\nstates everywhere have unleashed massive cuts in welfare. The consequences have\\nbeen disastrous for the majority of the people of this world.\\nWHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\\nIn this lesson you would have learnt how the social processes that began in the 19th\\ncentury were deepened and accelerated during the 20th century. Among these were\\nthe demographic changes, the growth of urbanization and changes in city life. The\\nspread of capitalist industrialization led to the emergence of modern class society all\\nover the world and changes in family and work patterns.

However, it is important to note that society is transformed not\\njust by dramatic occurrences but also many slow and long term changes in economy\\nand culture and demography. The twentieth century was also a period of numerous\\nsuch changes some of which were imperceptible to people living through them but\\nwhich, in the long run, played a major role in giving to the world its present form.\\nIn the previous chapter you learnt about a number of such developments including\\ndemographic explosion, rapid urbanization and the phenomenal growth of the middle\\nand the working classes over the past century.\\nFig. 28.1.2 African\\nLiberation\\nFig. 28.1.4 Fascism\\nin Italy\\nFig. 28.1.1 Bolshevik\\nRevolution stoming of Fort\\nFig. 28.1.3 Attack on\\nPearl Harbour world\\nWar II\\nFig. 28.1.5 Ethiopia\\nLiberation Movement\\nFig. 28.1.6 Trench\\nin World War I\\n165\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nAkin to such changes in the social structure or relations between major social groups in\\ndifferent countries, cultural transformation i.e. changes in people’s values, attitudes,\\nartistic tastes etc. also came during the same period through a slow and long term\\ntransformation. In the following chapter we shall try to closely examine some of these\\ncultural changes and also assess whether they are leading to the evolution of a widely\\nshared global culture today or to more tensions and frictions between cultures. \\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n•\\nexplain the various meanings of the term culture;\\n•\\nhighlight the peculiar features and problems of interpreting culture;\\n•\\nenumerate the major changes which came about in science, art, religion, educa-\\ntion, media, recreation and attitudes and values during the twentieth century and\\n•\\nassess the balance between ‘globalization’ or creation of an integrated world\\neconomy and culture and continuing resistance to western dominance today.\\n28.1 CULTURE DEFINED\\nBut before we begin our journey into cultural changes of the twentieth century, it\\nwould be useful to carefully examine the various meanings given to the term\\nculture in different disciplines.\\nIndeed, culture is one of the most complex terms in social sciences. Not only because\\nit refers to a wide range of attributes such as customs, habits and values etc. which\\nare difficult to measure or quantify but also because the term has been used in a\\nvariety of ways by different scholars.\\nFor example, in official announcements and news bulletins, the term culture is fre-\\nquently used to refer to artistic creations and intellectual achievements primarily.\\nThus Indian culture is showcased through our classical and folk music, dance forms,\\nliterature etc. with this usage of the term.\\nIn a sharp departure from this notion, anthropologists use the term culture to refer to\\nthe whole way of life of a community including its cuisine, dress, work and leisure\\nroutines as well as popular customs, festivals etc. In this usage the focus is not so\\nmuch on the exclusive or classical achievements of great artists and thinkers but on\\neveryday practices which have been traditionally shared or accepted in a community.\\nThus in the study of Indian culture the focus on our popular festivals, religious tradi-\\ntions and also the caste system would be important according to this definition.\\nIn yet another interpretation of the term culture, it is the implicit values, beliefs\\nand attitudes widely shared or understood in a community that are recognized as\\nthe core of any culture. Thus Indian culture is supposed to have traditionally valued\\nfamily bonds and respect for elders much more than the western world where\\nchildren mostly leave their parents after marriage and the marital bond has also\\nbecome extremely fragile.  \\nIn contrast to this concern with mentalities or ideals and belief patterns, archaeologists\\nprefer to focus on material culture or commonly used artifacts such as pottery, jewelry,\\nbuildings etc. of ancient communities whose remains they try to locate through excavations.\\n166\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nIf you were to carefully review the preceding definitions you would note that culture\\ncan be studied with two different criteria in mind: of artistic and intellectual refine-\\nment on one hand and of historically shared or popular traditions on the other. The\\nlatter can also be identified at different levels: in material objects, practices or in\\nvalues and attitudes.\\nFollowing these multiple facets of culture, we shall now briefly go through some\\noutstanding developments in related fields such as the sciences, arts, entertainment,\\nvalues, religion and education which were witnessed in the twentieth century.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 28.1\\n1.\\nGive two example each of revolutionary and slow modes of change witnessed in\\nthe twentieth century.\\n2.\\nCompare and contrast various interpretations of the term culture. Can you locate\\nsome common features in these interpretations?\\n3.\\nWhy is culture such a difficult term in social sciences?\\n28.2 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\\nPerhaps the most remarkable achievement of the twentieth century was the phenom-\\nenal growth of science and technology which affected and transformed every aspect\\nof life from entertainment and education to transport and communication at a very\\nrapid pace during the period. Cars and aeroplanes, radio and transistors, movies and\\ntelevision, calculators and computers, satellites and mobile phones and lasers and\\norgan transplants are only some of the new products and services made available by\\nmodern technology during the preceding century.\\nBehind this spate of technological innovations lay very intricate developments in vari-\\nous scientific realms such as sub atomic physics, genetic and molecular biology and\\nspace research. Some of the famous scientists who made major discoveries in these\\nfields were Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Fyneman and Homi J. Bhabha.\\nFig. 28.2.1 Marie\\nCurry, Discovery of\\nRadioactivity\\nFig. 28.2.3 Albert\\nEinstin, Nuclear\\nScientist\\nFig. 28.2.4 Homi J.\\nBhabha`, Nuclear\\nScientist\\nFig.\\n28.2.2 Richard P\\nFyneman\\n167\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nBut by and large recent scientific advancements have not been a product of individual\\ngenius so much as of large teams of scientists drawn from various countries of the\\nworld and concentrated in heavily funded research centers in advanced countries,\\nspecially the USA.\\nIt is also important to note that while contemporary science and technology have\\noffered numerous benefits to people, at the same time, the apprehension and fear of\\nscience amongst people has also grown simultaneously. Partly this is due to the in-\\ncomprehensibility of latest advances in modern science even to educated laymen.\\nWhat makes modern science perhaps even more awesome is its power to manufac-\\nture evermore destructive weapons and to threaten the delicate ecological balance on\\nthe earth.\\nObviously, social accountability and responsibility of scientists and governments pro-\\nmoting and guiding scientific research is high in the present epoch. \\nThe Arts and Literature\\nBesides science, the twentieth century has also been a time of considerable growth\\nof art forms such as painting, music and literature and of the emergence of some\\ntotally novel artistic media such as cinema and recorded music.\\nSome of the major art movements which shaped new creative work in this period\\nacross countries were modernism, socialist realism and postmodernism. In fact mod-\\nernism evolved as ‘avant garde’ or leading art trend in Europe in the last quarter of\\nnineteenth century and became a worldwide influence in the twentieth century.\\nAlthough modernism had diverse streams such as symbolism, impressionism and sur-\\nrealism, one major tendency common to them all has been the urge to uncover the\\ndeeper world of subconscious feelings and thoughts instead of portraying the appar-\\nent world of objects and persons as they appear. Further, to give expression to this\\nmodernist concern with subjective and subconscious elements, conventional modes\\nof artistic expression had also to be transcended and new and bold experiments tried\\nrepeatedly which often look extremely abstract and incomprehensible to an untrained\\nviewer.\\nSome of the great modernists who evolved their own styles in this vein were the\\nSpanish painter Pablo Picasso famous for introducing ‘cubism’ or multi dimensional\\nview of figures in paintings and the famous Irish writer James Joyce who introduced\\nthe technique of ‘the stream of consciousness’ in his work called Ulysses.\\nFig. 28.3 Picasso\\n168\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nIronically, while most modernists were extremely bold and experimental in evolving\\nnew modes of artistic expression, in their social and political outlook, many of them\\nremained apathetic to political challenges of their time and deeply pessimistic about\\nmodern civilization or even the human condition as a whole.\\nIn the same period, however, another branch of artists expressed a more forward\\nlooking and hopeful vision of social transformation in their works through the genre of\\nsocialist realism. Playwrights like Bertold Brecht in Germany and George Bernard\\nShaw of Britain and novelists like Maxim Gorki and poets like Alexander Blok in\\nRussia can be counted as the leading lights of this trend. These poets and writers\\nwere inspired by the ideals of an egalitarian transformation of society.\\nThe Bolshevik Revolution and the creation of the Soviet Union inspired many and\\nsocialist realism as an art trend continued to inspire considerable creative work in\\nmany non communist countries caught in the fierce trap of colonial, feudal and capi-\\ntalist exploitation simultaneously. In India, for example, the Progressive Writers’ As-\\nsociation was formed by master poets like Majaz and Josh in 1940s with explicit left\\nsympathies, and other masters such as Premchand reflected deep social concerns in\\ntheir realist accounts of rural life of their times. Similarly, in China, great realist writ-\\ning with socialist leanings was penned by a genius like Lu Hsun while in Latin America\\nthe anti US resistance inspired the poetry of Pablo Neruda.\\nIn fact, the flowering of art and literature in Asian, African and Latin American\\ncountries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is one of the most significant\\ndevelopments of recent times. Artists in such countries gave expression to the\\nnationalist aspirations on one hand and also dealt with the problem of feudal and\\nemerging capitalist exploitation within their societies, as also the peculiar chal-\\nlenge of synthesizing their traditions with a rapid surge of modernization on the\\nother. From the creative genius of Rabindranath Tagore a hundred years ago to\\nthe post colonial musings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez in Latin America and Chinua\\nAcebe of Africa, this engagement has produced some of the finest literature of\\nrecent times. \\nPhilosophy and the Human Sciences\\nIn terms of students, faculty positions in universities and publications, the Human\\nSciences (Social Sciences and Psychology) have seen a phenomenal expansion in\\nthe twentieth century and specially after the Second World War in most countries of\\nthe world.\\nHowever, along with expansion and the growing race for publications and promotions\\namongst social scientists has come a growing tendency for specialization and jargon\\nwhich characterizes lots of academic writing today.\\nIn fact, the birth of specialized disciplines from a comprehensive and unspecialized\\napproach to social and philosophical enquiry can be traced back to early nineteenth\\ncentury in Europe when economics, political science, sociology, anthropology and\\npsychology gradually emerged as distinct disciplines with their own specific methods\\nand delimited concerns.\\nMeanwhile, philosophy under the influence of thinkers like A.J. Ayer and Wittgenstein\\nitself shifted focus increasingly from probing broader questions about ethics and poli-\\ntics to a narrower and rigorous concern with clarifying the nature of language and\\nsymbols through which issues are posed.\\n169\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nThis does not imply that broader questions about causation, human nature and change\\nare not being posed today. Great thinkers like Bertrand Russell, Noam Chomsky and\\nLouis Althusser continued to write on a broad range of concerns.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 28.2.1\\n1.\\nName four outstanding scientists of the twentieth century along with the\\ndiscoveries.\\n2.\\nName the major art movements which influenced artists and writers across\\nnations in the twentieth century.\\n3.\\nName a few thinkers who continued to write innovatively on ethical and political\\nissues at a time when excessive specialization and jargon came to dominate the\\nmajority of scholarly writing in the preceding century.\\n28.3 CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND SYMBOLS\\nWhile changing concerns and achievements of scientists, philosophers and artists are\\nimportant aspects of cultural history, changes in cultural institutions such as religions,\\nfolklore, language, education systems and the mass media are also extremely signifi-\\ncant to note in any study of cultural change. Anthropologists refer to these as cultural\\ninstitutions or symbol systems which represent coherent patterns of values and\\nworldview to the participants. Such cultural symbols are of  historical significance\\nnot only because they address basic human needs for information, entertainment and\\nfaith or ‘meaning’ in life but also because they have a major role in shaping popular\\nvalues, beliefs, emotions and behavior patterns commonly observed in different\\nsocial groups.\\nFig. 28.4.2 Amartya Sen\\nFig. 28.4.1 E. P.\\nThompson\\nGreat Thinkers\\n170\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nBut it is important to note here that in most societies, the regulation and control of\\ncultural institutions such as education and the mass media is mostly in the hands of\\nthe dominant elites who control property as well as centres of power. You are famil-\\niar with the Brahmanical influence on Hindu beliefs regarding caste system, sati etc.\\nwhich enabled the upper castes especially in ancient India to monopolise the fruits of\\nlabor performed by the Sudras. Similarly, in modern times, the capitalist class exer-\\ncises vast influence on the mass media and seeks to mould popular beliefs and atti-\\ntudes in such a way as to facilitate its dominance over the exploited masses with or\\nwithout the use of force.   \\nWithin this general model of the operation of cultural institutions, numerous variations\\ncan be seen in their characteristics or ‘meaning’. The past century was indeed a time\\nof rapid transformation when fundamental changes occurred not only in the message\\nand content of education, religion and folklore etc. but also in the balance between\\nthese major cultural institutions across countries.\\nLANGUAGES\\nOne of the principal ingredients of any culture is its language. The twentieth century\\nwitnessed a dramatic transformation of the linguistic map of the world as local dia-\\nlects spoken by the masses as well as classical languages like Sanskrit and Latin,\\nwhich had been the privileged media of learning amongst scholars for centuries, gave\\nway to select national languages adopted by regions to express their emerging na-\\ntional identities.\\nIt has been estimated that nearly 6500 languages are still spoken in the world today.\\nNearly half of these are spoken by tiny communities and are in the process of be-\\ncoming extinct already. Ten major languages are mother tongues of more than half of\\nworld’s population already. (Source: Foundation for Endangered Languages website)\\nAnother interesting feature of the changing language pattern of the globe in recent\\ntimes has been the growth of bilinguism or familiarity with at least two languages\\namongst a growing number of educated people across the globe. The English lan-\\nguage has particularly emerged as the second adopted language with the growth of\\nglobalization and the emergence of the internet. While the Chinese remain the big-\\ngest linguistic group in the world still, the number of people knowing English (about\\n10% of global population) is second and the number knowing English as second\\nlanguage is the highest.\\nAnother major development amongst languages in the twentieth century under the\\nimpact of growing education and mass media has been the growing mixture between\\nthem. While English itself has adopted a number of new words from other languages\\nincluding French and Hindi, the evolution of Hinglish or the spoken mixture of Hindi,\\nUrdu and English amongst educated Indians is also noteworthy in this context.\\nFOLK TRADITIONS\\nThe twentieth century also saw a major transformation in the position of folklore in\\npopular culture across societies. Dozens of traditional arts and modes of entertainment\\nsuch as puppet shows, story telling, mythological drama, folk dances etc have quietly\\nbut surely got marginalized within the past century over most of the developing world.\\nAge old songs, tales and fables which had been used by communities to both transmit\\nideas and values to succeeding generations rapidly lost ground to professionally pro-\\nduced entertainment and news programs broadcast through the modern mass media.\\n171\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nYet some effort is being made by states as well as civic agencies, as in India, to\\npreserve them through financial and institutional support now.\\nMASS MEDIA\\nOn the other hand radio, cinema, gramophone records, television, cassettes and CDs\\nand computers and mobile phones arrived in quick succession and revolutionized the\\nway we receive information, entertain ourselves, relate to each other or even think\\nand respond to social and political issues.\\nThough some of the new media like cinema and television have been used for produc-\\ning highly artistic and educational programs also by great artists of the century such as\\nCharlie Chaplin, Satyajit Ray and Steven Spielberg yet, the logic of advertising and the\\ncompetition for a mass audience which is the driving force behind these media has\\nencouraged more and more sensationalism, sex and violence in their programs.\\nThe attention commanded by these new channels of mass communication and enter-\\ntainment has been historic. Thus it was found during a survey that in the USA a\\nmajority of families already had two TV sets in 1980 and that an average child there\\nspent twice as much time before television as in study or sports.\\nRELIGION\\nBesides traditional art forms and folklore, another major cultural institution whose role in\\nmost societies has got delimited over the past century is religion. In both the developed and\\nthe developing world, predominantly secular outlooks and loyalties such as humanism,\\nnationalism and democracy have inspired vast movements and commitment amongst\\npeople over the past century. This is not to say that nationalists (who profess a strong\\nloyalty to a nation state) or the humanists (who value human life more than the after life)\\ncan’t be religious at the same time. Indeed, in almost all the countries, most people (spe-\\ncially women) continue to count themselves amongst believers to this day. In a 1981\\nsurvey of religious beliefs in the USA, for example, only  about 10% of people described\\nthemselves as atheists. Moreover, pilgrimages and the production of devotional literature\\nand songs etc has actually grown phenomenally over the past century.    \\nYet, the shrinking influence of religion in everyday life is also evident in the fact that\\nreligion does not permeate daily practices ranging from greetings, meals, celebra-\\ntions, public ceremonies etc specially in the cities in the manner it did only a hundred\\nyears back. Secondly, religious values and outlook do not entirely encompass other\\nmajor social institutions such as the state, arts etc. as they did earlier and a vast\\nnumber of our practices today are actually carried on in a manner quite contradictory\\nto common religious beliefs. Thus, only a century ago, most marriages even in the\\nwest were solemnized in the church and baptism for every new born was almost\\nmandatory. By 1990, it was discovered in France that only 30% of couples got mar-\\nried in church. Divorce and abortion which were prohibited by the church have be-\\ncome not only legalized in most countries in the west but also increasingly accepted\\nand destigmatised. Similar trends are visible in many Asian and African countries too.\\nEDUCATION\\nWhile religion has ceased to define, in recent times, the rules and ideals operative in a\\ngrowing number of social realms, modern education based on secular and scientific\\nknowledge has grown phenomenally over the same period. The requirements of modern\\neducated citizens proficient in reading, writing and calculations and proud of their\\n172\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nnational history and heritage was strongly felt not only for manning the modern posts\\nin the state and industrial and service sectors of the economy but also for creating a\\nhomogeneous body of citizens intrinsically loyal to their nation states.\\nMost western countries had made school education compulsory and affordable or\\nfree in the nineteenth century itself. In the previous century, the newly liberated\\nnations in Asia and Africa also made efforts in the same direction though with less\\nsuccess due to limited resources and the heavy burden of the colonial and alien\\npattern in their education systems. In our country, more than half of the population\\nremained non literate as late as 1980 and only in the preceding two decades has the\\nproportion of non literates come down to 25% approximately.\\nMeanwhile university education expanded rapidly from the middle of the twentieth\\ncentury. Thus, in 1939, in advanced countries like Britain and France, less than 0.1%\\nof the population were enrolled in colleges. By late 1990s, however, nearly 2% of the\\npopulation in most of these nations could be receiving college education (a twenty\\nfold increase). Indeed, between 1960 and 1980, higher education expanded phenom-\\nenally in the developing world too and similar proportion of students in these poorer\\ncountries got enrolled in universities soon even though their vocational and primary\\neducation still remained undeveloped. Further, due to a much smaller organized sec-\\ntor in their economies the problem of educated unemployed was also stupendous in\\nthese countries.\\nUniversity students have been active in social and cultural protests. The large scale and\\nsimultaneous student protests which spread like wild fire from New York and San\\nFransisco to Paris and Prague in 1968 are still remembered for their radicalism since\\nthey sought to not only oppose repressive state policies and educational elitism within\\nthese countries, but also spawned robust internationalism and anti war anti imperialist\\nsentiments by challenging US intervention in Vietnam. In the more recent decades,\\nhowever, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union and the proliferation of escapist\\nentertainment channels, student protests seem to be in a state of lull worldwide. \\nINTEXT QUESTIONS\\n1.\\nWhat is meant by the term cultural institutions in the given text?

The process of globalization may be defined as the emergence of a\\nmore and more integrated world with growing networks of multi-national trade, manu-\\nfacturing and finance as well as political and welfare agencies such as the United\\nNations and professional bodies such as the World Social Forum uniting an over-\\nwhelming number of people in ties of interdependence though on unequal terms fa-\\nvoring the rich.\\nThe growth of  multi national corporations, the availability of goods and services from\\nacross the globe in city malls and over the internet, cheap and instant communication\\nof ideas, news and information across the globe, the emergence of global trends and\\nmarkets in fashion, food and entertainment are all indications of the extent of global-\\nization apparent today.\\nHere it is important to understand that globalization did not suddenly emerge in the\\ntwentieth century. Global trading networks and flow of medical and technical knowl-\\nedge can be traced back to earlier periods too. The process of colonization of non\\nEuropean countries by European powers from the beginning of the sixteenth century\\nstepped up the unequal integration of the world in a phenomenal way. But the growth\\nof powerful and far reaching transnational corporations and associations and global\\nmedia networks are more specific to the preceding century only.\\nWhile these new channels enable global flows of goods, services and information and\\nmay be expected to bring greater choice and possibly prosperity to some regions, the\\nreality is that not only have they suddenly disrupted age old cultural patterns and social\\ncustoms but are also moulding the entire world in western habits and values generally,\\nbesides further sharpening inequalities between the rich and the poor across the globe.\\nUnfortunately, within this advance of western ideas and habits across the globe again,\\nthe migration of the great ideals of liberty, equality and democracy into the non west-\\nern world have been much more difficult than the contagion of western individualism,\\nmaterialism, break up of the joint family and community ties, loneliness, neurosis etc.\\nOn top of this, in many developing countries, the problems of rampant poverty, cor-\\nruption, criminalization, lawlessness or dictatorships still complicate the situation omi-\\nnously.\\nIn this scenario, great responsibility falls on the shoulders of the young to make the\\nright choices between enticing options and steer their countries through the whirlwind\\nof cultural and social change expected to accelerate in the new century.\\nWHAT YOU HA\\nVE LEARNT\\nWhile leaders, battles and revolutions have a major influence on the world at times,\\nslow and imperceptible changes in demography, social classes and widely shared\\nbeliefs, values and attitudes also transform it cumulatively.\\nThe twentieth century was a unique time of major changes of the latter type too.\\nThus science and technology grew on a phenomenal pace in this period while the arts,\\nphilosophy and literature experienced worldwide movements such as Modernism,\\nSocialist Realism and Postmodernism, and universal cultural institutions such as lan-\\nguage, religion, education and mass media saw mammoth quantitative and qualitative\\nchanges in their working.\\n174\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 5\\nContemporary World\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\\nAs a result of these all round and speedy transformations, the world is also becoming\\nmore and more globalised now.

What exactly do we mean by it?\\nUsually, we associate the state with certain forms of government. These could be\\nmonarchies or republics, or in some instances, oligarchis. i.e. the rule of few. These\\ndistinctions rest on the way power, i.e. the ability to influence and control the lies of\\npeople, is either concentrated in the hands of a few or shared amongst many.\\nThose who control states, whom we identify as rulers, regulate political relations, and\\nfunction through a variety of institutions. These include administrative services, used\\nfor a range of functions such as revenue collection, the army, and judiciary. Rulers\\nalso try to convince people that the form of government that they head is ideal. In\\nother words, they try to legitimize the existence of the state.\\nStates have developed over a long period of time, and in different ways. In this lesson\\nwe will explore some of the earliest trends in the subcontinent.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to:\\n•\\ndistinguish between chiefdoms and kingdoms;\\n•\\nexplain the feature of early kingdoms and\\n•\\nunderstand how some of these early kingdoms became powerful states.\\n29.1 THE BACKGROUND\\nIn earlier lessons you may have studied about the Harappan civilization. This was a\\nvery well-developed civilization, with large cities, where people produced a wide\\nvariety of things. Some scholars have suggested that there must have been a state\\norganization in the Harappan civilization. This is very likely, but we do not have the\\nevidence to figure out what kind of state this was, and we do not have details about\\nadministrative institutions.\\n(i) Chiefdoms in Early Vedic Literature\\nYou have read about the Rigveda in earlier lessons (lesson 4). The Rigveda was\\nprobably composed between 1800-1000 BC. This is a collection of hymns addressed\\nto various gods, in particular to Agni, Indra and Soma. Generally, the hymns were\\n2\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE\\ncomposed by members of priestly families. They were usually chanted when sacrifices\\nwere performed, and were used to invite the gods to the rituals. Most of the hymns were\\ncomposed in north – west India, in the region drained by the Indus and its tributaries.\\nThe hymns also contain other information. They include lists of things for which\\npeople prayed. And they occasionally give us the names of chiefs or important men of\\nthose times.\\nDo the hymns provide us the information about the political processes? Well, the\\nanswer is a qualified yes. The hymns do not provide us with direct information about\\npolitical events (expect in some rare instances). At the same time, the contents of the\\nhymns can be analyzed to understand how political relations were organized.\\n(ii) Rajas with a difference\\nGenerally, when we use the term raja we have an idea that this is a man who lives in\\na palace, has a large number of servants under his command, is extremely rich, is the\\nhead of a large army, and has a court. And we usually think of rajas passing down\\ntheir power to their sons. Preferably the eldest son. Yet, the term raja did not always\\nhave this meaning.\\nIn the Rigveda, the term raja is used as an adjective for a number of gods. It is also\\noccasionally used to describe powerful men. These men did no control a vast army or\\na large administrative system. Their main source of power was probably derived\\nfrom leadership in warfare. Let us see why battles were fought, and what happened\\nafter that.\\n29.1.4 Battles\\nYou may remember that the Rigveda indicates that people at that time were primarily\\nfarmers. So we find that some battles were fought to acquire pasture land. Usually,\\nthe best pasture lands were along rivers. Battles were also fought for water for both\\npeople and animals, to capture cattle and land, especially for pasture, and for growing\\nhardy crops that ripened quickly, such as barley. Besides, battles were fought to\\ncapture women.\\nMost men took part in these wars. There was no regular army, but there were assem-\\nblies where people met and discussed matters of war and peace. They also choose\\nleaders, brave and skillful warriors. Sometimes, they performed special sacrifices\\nand prayed to the gods for success in battle.\\nWhat happned if the raja led his people to victory? Lands that were won or water\\nsources to which access was gained were probably held and used in common. Other\\nthings, such as cattle and women, were probably distributed amongst the raja’s sup-\\nporters. Some of these were given to priests, who performed sacrifices both to pray\\nfor the victory of the raja as well as to thank the gods for supporting their ruler when\\nhe was victorious.\\nWho did they fight with? The Rigveda contains the names of a number of tribes. These\\ninclude the Purus, Yadus, Bharatas, Anus, and Druhus. Sometime these tribes united\\nwith one another, but they also fought with one another. Sometimes, these people, who\\ncalled themselves Aryas, fought with others, whom they called Dasas or Dasyus.\\nWe find two terms being used for the common people. One is the word jana, which is\\noften used in Hindi and other languages even today. The other is the term vis. Usually,\\n3\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE\\nthe raja is referred to as the raja of a jana or a vis. In other words, the raja was not\\nregarded as the raja of a kingdom or a fixed territory, but of a group of people.\\nAs we have seen, these rajas are not quite like those we are familiar with. They have\\noften been regarded as chiefs rather than kings, and the realm over which they exer-\\ncised control has been defined as a chiefdom rather than as a kingdom.\\n•\\nChiefs are usually chosen by the people, either directly or indirectly, whereas\\nkings are hereditary.\\n•\\nChiefs usually do not have any permanent administrative mechanism to support\\nthem: they depend on the support of kinsfolk and other followers. While kings\\nmay also depend on their relatives for support, they have additionally, an admin-\\nistrative system to depend on.\\n•\\nChiefs do not collect regular taxes: instead, they often depend on gifts that may\\nbe brought in by their followings. Kings may receive gifts, but their major source\\nof revenue is usually derived from tax collection.\\n•\\nChiefs do not maintain standing armies: they depend on militia, i.e. people who\\nare called upon to fight as and when necessary, and who are not paid regular\\nsalaries. Kings may continue to recruit people as militia, but usually also maintain\\nstanding armies.\\n•\\nGenerally, chiefs interact with peple in assemblies, where people can express\\ntheir opinions on important matters. Kings also participate in assemblies, but\\nthese tend to be more formal occasions.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.1\\n1.\\nThe Rigveda was probably composed between \\n , \\nB.C.\\n2.\\nThe hymns do not provide us with direct information about \\n events.\\n3.\\nUsually the best pastures lands are along \\n .\\n4.\\nThe people who called themselves as Aryas, fought with others, whom they\\ncalled \\n or \\n.\\n29.2 THE EARLIEST KINGDOMS: JANAPADAS\\nBetween about 1000 BC and 500 BC, certain important developments took place in\\nnorth India. We now find a growth in the number of settlements, often associated\\nwith the Painted Grey Ware culture about which you have learnt in lesson five. Amongst\\nother things, settled agriculture became more important, there was a growth in\\npopulation, and iron was increasingly used to make tools and weapons.\\nWe also have a very elaborate set of texts, which we refer to as the later Vedic\\nliterature. These texts deal with rituals, explaining them, analyzing them, and de-\\nscribing how they were to be performed incidentally, they suggest that a new form\\nof political organization that is often referred as the janapada was now becoming\\nmore important.\\n4\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE\\nAs is obvious, the term janapada was derived from the word jana, which, as we have\\nseen, referred to people. In fact, janapada means where the jana places its feet and\\nsettles down. The land was now named after them. For example, the land where the\\nKurus settled down was known as Kuru janapada.\\nAnother distinctive feature of the janapadas was that the population living in these\\nterritories was often classified according to varna, the four fold social classification\\nabout which you learnt in lesson four.\\n29.3 NEW WAYS OF BECOMING OF RAJA\\nThe leader or chief of the janapada continued to be called a raja. But there were\\nimportant wasys in which this raja was different from that of the jana. To start with, we\\nhave indications that in some cases at least, the position of the raja was now hereditary.\\nIn other words, sons inherited or could legitimately claim the kingdom of their fathers.\\nSecondly, we now find mention of elaborate rituals, of which the rajasuya and the\\nasvamedha are the most well known. These were ling, sometimes lasting for more\\nthan a year. Only specially trained priests could perform them. The priests who com-\\nposed and compiled Vedic literature now stated that whoever was capable of per-\\nforming these elaborate rituals would be recognized as king.\\nMany people were expected to take part in such sacrifices. These included the raja.\\nThis was major occasion for declaring his power. His family, especially his wives and\\nsons, had to help him in the sacrifices. His other supporters, including the chariot driver,\\nfamily priest, (purohita), head of the army, messengers also joined in. The common\\npeople, the vis or vaishya, were expected to bring gifts for the raja, which provided\\nmuch of the wealth needed to perform the sacrifice. Neighbouring rajas were often\\ninvited to watch the spectacle. And of course priests conducted the entire ritual.\\nCould shudras take part in the rituals? Sometimes they were given small roles in the\\nrituals, but very often they were excluded from them. Even those who participated\\ncould only play their own parts. For example, the vaishya could not act as priest, nor\\ncould the raja’s wife take his place.\\nWhat did these rituals entail? In the case of the asvamedha or the horse sacrifice, the\\nsacrificial horse was let loose to wander for a year, accompanied by a group of armed\\nmen. All those who allowed the horse to pass through tacitly acknowledged the\\nauthority of the owner of the horse.\\nWhen the horse was brought back, it was sacrificed in an elaborate ritual. Large\\nnumbers of people, including other rulers, priests, and common people, were invited to\\nparticipate in and/or witness the event. There was feasting and story–telling as well.\\nIn other words, this was an enormous, expensive ceremony.\\nAny aspiring ruler who wanted to perform such a ritual had to be both powerful and\\nwealthy. The priests were rewarded with large sacrificial fees or daksina. These\\ncould include horses, cattle, gold and silver objects, chariots, cloths, and slave men\\nand women, amongst other things. Thus, by performing the ritual successfully, the\\nraja was able to make a public announcement, as well as a display of this power.\\nMany of these rituals included an abhiseka. This meant a sprinkling of the ruler with\\npurified, holy water. Usually, the first sprinkling was done by the priest, though others,\\nsuch as the vaisya and the ruler’s relatives, could also participate in the process.\\n5\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE\\nAs you can see, there was now no question of popular assembly choosing a raja. A\\nman could become a raja if he was born into a ruling family, or try to become one if he\\nhad adequate military and material resources.\\n29.4 THE BEGINNINGS OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM\\nOne of the rituals frequently described in later Vedic text in the rajasuya. If you are\\nfamiliar with the story of the Mahabharat, you may remember that the rajasuya was\\nan important sacrifice that was performed by Udhisthira in order to claim the throne.\\nAs part of the rajasuya, there is mention of a ritual known as he ratninam havimsi.\\nThis is a ritual in which the raja was expected to make offerings in the homes of\\nimportant people, referred to as ratnins, (literally those who possessed jewels). These\\nimportant people included the wives of the ruler, the leader of the army, the chief\\npriest, the charioteer, and some other, including messengers and those who collected\\nor received gifts on behalf of the ruler.\\nThere is no mention of regular salaries being paid to these “officials.” However, given\\ntheir functions, we can suggest that some of them perhaps formed the nucleus from\\nwhich later administrative system developed.\\n29.5 RESOURCES FOR THE RAJA\\nAlthough the raja who rules over the janapada was in many ways different from the\\nraja as described in the Regveda, he shared certain features with him as well. We\\nfind that even during this period, the main ways in which the raja could acquire re-\\nsources was through battle, and through gifts.\\nThese gifts, often referred to as bali, could be demanded on rituals occasions. For\\nexamples, if the raja was performing an asvamedha, he could demand resources\\nfrom his people. While the term “gift” suggests a voluntary offering. People could be\\npersuaded and perhaps even forced to make gifts.\\nWe find that the texts use certain new analogies to describe the relationship between\\nthe raja and his people. The raja is described as the cater, or the deer and the people\\nas the food or the fodder. This does suggest that people were occasionally exploited\\neven though regular taxes were not demanded.\\nAt the same time, people may have made offering to the raja in order to win his support,\\nand to ensure that he was both able and willing to protect them from other rulers.\\nAnother similarity between the raja of the Rigveda and the raja of the later Vedic\\ntradition was the dependence on a militia for armed support. Can you think about why\\nthe ruler may not have been able to maintain a standing army?\\n29.6 MAHAJANAPADAS\\nBy about 500 BC, some janapadas became more powerful than the others and were\\nnow known as mahajanpadas. Buddhist and Jaina text provide us with lists of 16\\nmahajanapadas. The more important amongst these, as well as their capital cities, are\\nshown on the map. (please see table no. 5.1 in Book 1 p 67 and map on 68)\\nFor janapadas were particularly important. These were those of Kosala, Avanti, Vajji, and\\nMagadha. Of these, ultimately Magadha became the most powerful janapada. The Mauryan\\nempire, the first known empire in the history of the subcontinent, had its centre in Magadha.\\n6\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THE STATE\\nThe mahajanapadas differed from the janapadas in a ways. Let us look at some of\\nthese differences.\\n29.7 FORTIFIED CITIES\\nAlmost all the mahajanpads had a capital city. Unlike the settlements in the janapadas\\nmany of these were fortified. This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone\\nwere build around them.\\nWe have some idea of the people who lived in these cities. These included the rulers\\nand their supporters, and other such as craftsmen, merchants, traders, and small shop\\nkeepers. Some of the people who lived in such cities were wealthy men and women.\\nMany of the cities that we know today developed during this period. These include\\ncities like Mathura, Varanasi, Vaishali and Pataliputra. These cities were sustained by\\ndevelopments in agriculture, where, with the use of the iron tools, it now became\\npossible to produce more food.\\nForts were probably built because some of the people who lived in cities were afraid\\nof attacks and needed protection. It is also likely that some rulers wanted to show\\nhow rich and powerful they were building really large, tall, impressive walls around\\ntheir cities.\\nBuilding such huge walls required a great deal of planning. Thousands, if not lakh of\\nbricks of stone had to be prepared. This in turn meant enormous labour, provided,\\npossible, by thousands of men, women and children. And of course, money had to be\\nfound to pay for all of this.\\n29.8 NEW ARMIES\\nBy about 330 BC, we have evidence to suggest that the armies in some of these\\nmahajanpadas were organized differently. This was the time when Alexander, a ruler\\nof Macadonia, to the north of Greece, decided to embark on an expedition to conquer\\nthe world. As may be expected, he did not conquer the world. However, he con-\\nquered part of Egypt, West Asia and came to the Indian subcontinent, reaching up to\\nthe banks of the Beas.\\nWhen he wanted to move further eastwards, his soldiers refused. They were scared\\nas they had heard that the rulers of India had vast armies of foot soldiers, chariots and\\nelephants.\\nThese armies were very different from the ones mentioned earlier. Soldiers in the\\nnew army were paid regular salaries and maintained by the king throughout the year.\\nWe also find elephants being used on a large scale. If we remember that elephants\\nare difficult to capture, tame and train, it becomes evident that now armies have\\nbecome far more elaborate and well organized than before. And maintaining such\\nlarge armies would have required far more resources than what was needed for the\\nsimple armies of the janapadas.\\nWe learn from Buddhist texts that the rulers of Magadha build up on the best armies.\\nThey used elephants found in the forests within the state. They also used iron from\\nthe mines within their kingdom.

These rituals were not like the Vedic sacri-\\nfices. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through\\ndiscussion and debate. For examples, if they were attacked by enemy, they met in\\ntheir assembly to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. And instead of\\nstanding armies, we find that the rajas all joined together, with their followers, to form\\nan army as and when required.\\nAll the land of the gana sanghas was owned by all the rajas together (jointly).

During\\nthis period we see a hierarchy of centralized and decentralized governments, some of\\nwhich were highly organized in their political structure and government while others\\nwere merely weakened by internal problems and division of power.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n•\\nexplain as to how the state system developed in early India;\\n•\\ndistinguish between various kinds of states and\\n•\\nunderstand how most powerful states emerged.\\n30.1 BACKGROUND\\nIn the beginning human society had the belief that all human beings are equal and\\nshould have same rights, as it was basically a tribal society. Emergence of idea of\\nstate was a result of conflicts over control of resources and development of a differ-\\nentiated economy or the society arranged itself at separate levels. Development of a\\nclass based society was an essential pre- requisite for changing the state system.\\nGrowth of population and development of sedentary life were the other factors.\\n30.2 GROWTH OF IDEA OF KINGSHIP\\nThe archeological evidences uncovered a strong centralized authority in Harappa. In\\nthe Vedic monarchies, the clan -chief became the king and was gradually invested\\nwith a status i.e equal to being god. Buddhist and Jaina thought ignored the idea of\\ndivinity and assumed instead that, in the original state of nature, all needs were effort-\\nlessly provided but that slowly a decline set in and man became evil, developing\\ndesires, which led to the notions of private property and of family and finally to im-\\nmoral behaviour. In this condition of chaos, the people gathered together and decided\\nto elect one among them (the mahasammata, or “great elect”) in whom they would\\ninvest authority to maintain law and order. Thus, gradually the institution of the state\\ncame into being. Later theories retained the element of a contract between the ruler\\nand the people. Brahmanic sources held that the gods appointed the ruler and that a\\n12\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nEARLY STATES\\ncontract of dues was concluded between the ruler and the people. Also prevalent\\nwas the theory of matsyanyaya, which proposes that in periods of chaos, when there\\nis no ruler, the strong devour the weak, just as in periods of drought, big fish eat little\\nfish. Thus, the need for a ruler was viewed as absolute. The existence of the state\\nwas primarily dependent on two factors: danda (authority) and dharma (in its sense\\nof the social order i.e., the preservation of the caste structure). The Artha-sastra,\\nmoreover, refers to the seven limbs (saptanga) of the state as the king, administra-\\ntion, territory, to capital, treasury, forceful authority, and allies. However, the impor-\\ntance of the political notion of the state gradually began to fade, partly because of a\\ndecline of the political tradition of the republics and the proportional dominance of the\\nmonarchical system, in which loyalty was directed to the king. The emergence of the\\nMauryan Empire strengthened the political notion of monarchy. The second factor\\nwas that the dharma, in the sense of the social order, demanded a far greater loyalty\\nthan did the rather blurred idea of the state. The king’s duty was to protect dharma,\\nand, as long as the social order remained intact, anarchy would not prevail. Loyalty to\\nthe social order, which was a fundamental aspect of Indian civilization, largely ac-\\ncounts for the impressive continuity of the major social institutions over many centu-\\nries. However, it also shifted loyalty from the political notion of the state, which might\\notherwise have permitted more frequent empires and a greater political conscious-\\nness. After the decline of the Mauryas, the re- emergence of an empire was to take\\nmany centuries.\\n30.3 INDUS AND VEDIC POLITICAL / OR GOVERNMENTAL\\n          ORGANISATIONS: PRE–STATE TO STATE\\nThe urban civilization of Indus Valley suggests a complex planning that undertook the\\nregion and the people lived up to the standard of the time. Despite a growing body of\\narchaeological evidence, the social and political structures of the Indus “state” re-\\nmain objects of guess work. The remarkable uniformity of weights and measures\\nthroughout the Indus lands, as well as the development of such presumably civic\\nworks as the great granaries, implies a strong degree of political and administrative\\ncontrol over a wide area.\\nThe Aryans are said to have entered India through the fabled Khyber Pass, around\\n1500 BC and gave rise to another civilization in Indian history, the Vedic period. The\\nAryans were divided into tribes, which had settled in different regions of northwest-\\nern India. Tribal chieftainship gradually became hereditary, though the chief usually\\noperated with the help of advice from either a committee or the entire tribe. Tribal\\nchiefs bearing the title Raja or king were at first little more than war-lords, and their\\nprincipal duty was protection of their tribes. The power of the king positioned with the\\nhigher authority of the priests. Vedic kingship was the natural outcome of the condi-\\ntions surrounding the Aryans. A king was the leader of the people in the war of\\nattacking action and defense. He is called the “Protector of the people”. A study of\\nthe Rigveda shows that the king was no longer merely a leader of a primitive tribe, but\\noccupied a position of preeminence among the people.  The protection of the people\\nwas the sacred duty of the king.  In return, he expected and received loyal obedience\\nfrom his subjects in the sense of a tribute to the king.\\nThe Aryan tribes failed to unite against non-Aryans due to lack of strong political\\nfoundation and the unstable nature due to their internal caste system.  The weak\\ncharacter of the empire came from the rigid caste system that divided people and\\n13\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n EARLY  STATES\\ncreated unstable feelings among them. These were some of the reasons due to which\\nthe Vedic empire was far less organized than the Indus Valley Civilization.\\nTo begin with, during Vedic age there existed political units like jana which later\\nbecame janapada – mahajanapada. A jana was a region where lived the people\\nof the tribe. These tribes were named after a particular chieftain. Later, with the\\nextension of territory, there was a change in the nature of political organization.\\nStatecraft art of government evolved as a new system of government following the\\nVedic period. The solidarity of the tribal state and the political power of best warriors\\ngave rise to a new style of kingship. It aimed at the creation of more professional\\narmies and more dependent upon the king. The statecraft aimed at acquisition of\\nterritories rich in natural resources and tax-paying peasants rather than booty or\\nterritory for tribal expansion.\\n30.4 MAHAJANPADAS\\nThe centuries before the establishment of the Mauryan Empire – the period which\\nwas the development of the Kosala and Magadha kingdoms – were a period of\\nrelatively rapid social and economic change. We find the breaking into small pieces of\\ntribal polities, the development of the caste model and the move to the rice lands of\\nthe Eastern Gangetic Valley. In times of the disintegration of old social ties, during the\\nestablishment of new ways of being in social and political relationships, we find idea\\nbased on great change. The emergence of Buddhism and Jainism was a result of this\\nupheaval. From their original settlements in the Punjab region, the Aryans gradually\\nbegan to penetrate eastward, clearing dense forests and establishing “tribal” settle-\\nments along the Ganga and Yamuna (Jamuna) plains between 1500 and ca. 800 B.C.\\nBy around 500 B.C., most of northern India was inhabited and had been brought\\nunder cultivation, facilitating the increasing knowledge of the use of iron implements,\\nincluding ox-drawn ploughs, and spurred by the growing population that provided\\nvoluntary and forced labor. As river based and inland trade flourished, many towns\\nalong the Ganga became centers of trade, culture, and luxurious living. Increasing\\npopulation and surplus production provided the bases for the emergence of indepen-\\ndent states with fluid territorial boundaries over which disputes frequently arose.\\nThe basic administrative system headed by tribal chieftains was transformed by a\\nnumber of regional republics or hereditary monarchies that devised ways to appropri-\\nate revenue and to conscript labor for expanding the areas of settlement and\\nagriculture farther east and south, beyond the Narmada River. These emergent states\\ncollected revenue through officials, maintained armies, and built new cities and high-\\nways. By 600 B.C., sixteen such territorial powers stretched across the North India\\nplains from modern-day Afghanistan to Bangladesh. The right of a king to his throne,\\nno matter how it was gained, was usually made lawful through elaborate sacrifice\\nrituals and genealogies i.e history of members of a family from past to present\\nconcocted by priests who ascribed to the king divine or superhuman origins. In the\\ntexts we find references to the emergence of sixteen mahajanapadas. Important\\namong them were Magadha, Kosala, Kasi, Avanti, Vaishali, Lichhavi, etc.\\nMahajanapadas were of two kinds, as discussed below :\\n(i) Monarchical Mahajanpadas\\nFirst, there existed monarchical types, where the king or chieftain was the head of the\\nterritory. In this type, the Vedic ceremonies and brahmanas were given much\\n14\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nEARLY STATES\\nimportance. The kings performed vedic sacrifices in these regions. For instance, Kosala\\nbelonged to the category of monarchical mahajanapada. Prasenajit, the king of Kosala\\nwas known to have performed several sacrifices.\\n(ii) Republican Mahajanpadas\\nThe second type among mahajanapadas was republican or oligarchic which differed\\nfrom the monarchical states. In this second category, the king was selected from the\\ngroup of people called rajas. There is reference to assemblies called sabha where\\nthe members used to have discussions regarding a particular matter, then the item\\nwas put to vote.\\nIn one such assembly there is reference to the existence of 7707 rajas who repre-\\nsented the class of rajanyas who owned land that was cultivated by dasa, karmakaras\\nor labourers. The rajas were known for their ability to fight. In this category, Vedic\\nsacrifices were not given much importance and the brahmanas were given number\\ntwo social status after the kshatriyas. The main source for the study of these\\nmahajanapadas is the Buddhist texts.\\n(iii) Conflict between Monarchical Mahajanpadas and Republican\\n          Mahajanpadas\\nThe Vrijji confederacy (union of several states) near the foot of Himalayas was a\\npowerful oligarchy, which challenged the supremacy of some monarchical states.\\nMonarchical states like Magadha and Lichhavi were in a great state of difficult choice\\nas they were not able to extend their territories. Among the mahajanapadas, there\\nemerged conflict for power and supremacy. Magadha had an ambitious king called\\nAjatasatru, who decided to conquer the neighboring regions. Due to warfare and\\nmarriage alliances he was able to conquer Kosala and Kasi.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 30.1\\nCorrect and rewrite the following sentences:\\n1.\\nIn the begining human society was basically not a tribal society?\\n2.\\nThe emergence of the Ashoka the great strengthened the political nation of\\nmonarchy?\\n3.\\nThe Aryan tribes united against non – Aryans due to lack of strong political\\nfoundation?\\n4.\\nIn an assembly these were 7077/7707 rajas who represented the class of rajanyas?\\n30.5 RISE OF MAGADHA  AND MAURYAS\\nThus among monarchical states Magadha emerged as an important power. However,\\nhe had to fight for many years against Lichhavis. Ajatasatru sent his minister to sow\\n15\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n EARLY  STATES\\ndifferences among the tribes of Vrijji confederacy. Due to this effort, ultimately Ajatasatru\\nobtained success against Lichhavi which became part of Magadha empire.\\nThis region controlled the northern trade route called uttarapatha, while the south-\\nerly route called dakshinapatha was under the control of Magadha. Due to these\\nconquests, Magadha was able to manage economic resources like fertile river valleys\\nand iron ore mines which provided the necessary supply of materials for the produc-\\ntion of different goods. As a result it was in Magadha that we find the beginning of\\nsigns of state formation.\\nThe Mauryan Empire, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty, was the largest and most pow-\\nerful political and military empire of ancient India. Originating from the kingdom of\\nMagadha in the Indo-Gangetic plains of modern Bihar and Bengal and with its capital\\ncity of Pataliputra (near modern Patna), the Empire was founded in 322 BC by\\nChandragupta Maurya, who had overthrown the Nanda Dynasty and begun expand-\\ning his power across central and western India . The Empire was expanded into\\nIndia’s central and southern regions by Emperor Bindusara, but it excluded a small\\nportion of unexplored tribal and forested regions near Kalinga.\\nFollowing the conquest of Kalinga in a major war, Ashoka the Great ended the military\\nexpansion of the empire. The kingdoms of Pandya and Cheras in southern India thus\\npreserved their independence, accepting the supremacy of the Mauryan emperor. The\\nMauryan Empire was perhaps the greatest empire to rule the Indian subcontinent until\\nthe arrival of the British. Its decline began fifty years after Ashoka’s rule ended, and it\\ndissolved in 185 BC with the foundation of the Sunga Dynasty in Magadha.\\n30.6 THE MAURYAN STATE\\nChandragupta’s minister Kautilya Chanakya wrote the Arthashastra, one of the great-\\nest treatises on economics, politics, foreign affairs, administration, military arts, war,\\nand religion ever produced in the East. Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule\\nin South Asia falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The\\nArthashastra and the Edicts of Ashoka are primary sources of written records of the\\nMauryan times. The Lion Capital of Asoka at Sarnath, is the emblem of India.\\nThe Mauryan Empire consisted of a great variety of political formations and ecological\\nzones: it contained forest peoples and nomads, chieftaincies and oligarchies like the\\ngana– sangha confederacies of chiefs. It contained smaller kingdoms with a range of\\nadministrative structures not necessarily similar to that in Magadha. Different parts of\\nthe empire like the core, the metropolis and the peripheries were administered in differ-\\nent ways. Thus there did not exist a uniform method of administration in the whole of\\nMauryan Empire. While the core and the metropolis were directly administered by the\\nstate; the periphery region was given more autonomy as more importance was given to\\nthe collection of taxes and tributes from these regions. The administrative network\\nconsisted of an upper bureaucracy recruited from the upper castes and receiving hand-\\nsome salaries. There was no central method of recruitment and local persons appear to\\nhave been appointed in areas distant from the metropolitan state.\\nDuring the rule of Ashoka the Mauryan Empire was organized formally into five\\nparts. Magadha and some adjacent mahajanapadas were under direct administration.\\nThere is evidence from the reports of Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador, and from\\nthe Arthasastra, of relatively centralized administration in the centre part.\\n16\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nEARLY STATES\\n30.7 THE MAURYAN BUREAUCRACY\\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the royal capital at Pataliputra.\\nFrom Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are Tosali (in the\\neast), Ujjain (in the west), Suvarnagiri (in the south), and Taxila (in the north). The\\nhead of the provincial administration was the Kumara (royal prince), who gov-\\nerned the provinces as king’s representative. The kumara was assisted by\\nmahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected\\nat the imperial level with the Emperor and his Mantriparishad (Council of Minis-\\nters). The bureaucracy was not required to restructure conquered areas to con-\\nform to auniform pattern but to ensure the flow of revenue. At the peak period of\\nthe empire, mention is made of a group of officers, basically concerned with rev-\\nenue administration, who appear to have been centrally appointed and who were\\nrequired to tour the areas under their jurisdiction and enquire into the well-being of\\nthe subjects. Irrigation was considerably decentralized, frequently in small-scale\\nsystems drawing water from rivers, pools, wells, springs and artificial ponds called\\ntanks. More elaborate reservoirs and river banks were built with local resources,\\nthough the empire assisted irrigation works in newly settled lands. Evidence sug-\\ngests that irrigation works were locally controlled.\\nThe Mauryans appear to have had interest in gaining revenue from trade. They did\\nnot, here, either, however, take an active role in the regulation of trade. This is indi-\\ncated by the fact that they appear not to have issued metallic money of a distinctive\\nkind. The modest punch-marked coins which have been found may very well have\\nbeen issued by guilds or other local bodies. The state attempted to maintain control\\nover individual traders and guilds, inspecting their identity, their merchandise and their\\nprofits. The sale of goods at the place of production was not permitted, presumably\\nbecause sale in markets was more accessible to revenue collectors. The state\\ncollected a series of taxes at various points in the production of goods from raw\\nmaterials to commodities. Special officers were appointed to ensure standards and\\nprevent fraud as well as to intercept trade in those items which the state had a\\nmonopoly such as, weapons, armor, metals, and gems. Commodity production was\\ntherefore an independent enterprise geared to a market and trade was a major\\nrevenue resource for the state.\\nHistorians theorize that the organization of the empire was in line with the extensive\\nbureaucracy described by Kautilya in the Arthashastra: a sophisticated civil service\\ngoverned everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion\\nand defence of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been the\\nlargest standing army of its time. According to Megasthenes, the possessed wielded\\na military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, and 9,000 war elephants. A vast\\nespionage system collected intelligence for both internal and external security\\npurposes. Having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism, Ashoka neverthe-\\nless continued to maintain this large army, to protect the Empire and instill stability and\\npeace across West and South Asia.\\n30.8 POST MAURYAN STATES\\nPost Mauryan polity was marked by the arrival of central Asian conquerors i.e. the\\nIndo- Greeks, the Sakas, the Parthians and the Kushanas. They imposed their rule on\\nnative princes which paved the way for development of an organization based on\\nrelationship of a master and servant. The central Asians strengthened the idea of\\n17\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n EARLY  STATES\\ndivine origin of kingship.

This empire lasted for more than two centuries. It\\ncovered a large part of the Indian subcontinent, but its administration was more de-\\ncentralized than that of the Mauryas, but more centralized than Sungas.  The theory\\nof the divinity of kings became more popular during the Gupta period. Alternately\\nwaging war and entering into matrimonial alliances with the smaller kingdoms in its\\nneighborhood, the empire’s boundaries kept fluctuating with each ruler. The Gupta\\nrealm, although less extensive than that of the Mauryas, did encompass the northern\\nhalf and central parts of the subcontinent. The Gupta period also has been called an\\nImperial Age, but the administrative centralization so characteristic of an imperial\\nsystem is less apparent than during the Mauryan period. The Guptas tended to allow\\nkings to remain as serving in a slave like manner; unlike the Mauryas, they did not\\nconsolidate every kingdom into a single administrative unit. This would be the model\\nfor later Mughal rule and British rule built off of the Mughal paradigm.\\nThe Guptas, a comparatively unknown family, came from either Magadha or eastern\\nUttar Pradesh. The third king, Chandra Gupta I (Chandragupta I), took the title of\\nmaharajadhiraja. He married a Lichhavi princess- an event celebrated in a series\\nof gold coins. It has been suggested that, if the Guptas ruled in Prayaga (modern\\nAllahabad in eastern Uttar Pradesh), the marriage alliance may have added Magadha\\nto their domain. The Gupta era began in 320 BC. Chandra Gupta appointed his son\\nSamudra Gupta to succeed him about 330 BC, according to a long eulogy to Samudra\\nGupta inscribed on a pillar at Allahabad. The coins of an obscure prince, Kacha,\\nsuggest that there may have been contenders for the throne. Samudra Gupta’s\\ncampaigns took him in various directions and resulted in many conquests. Among\\nthose he rendered were willing to do what others want. They belonged to the rulers of\\nAryavarta, various forest chiefs, the northern oligarchies, and border States in the\\n18\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nEARLY STATES\\neast, in addition to Nepal. More distant domains brought within Samudra Gupta’s orbit\\nwere regarded as subordinate; these comprised the “king of kings” of the northwest,\\nthe Sakas, the Murundas, and the inhabitants of “all the islands”, including Sinhala\\n(Sri Lanka), all of which are listed in the inscription at Allahabad. The Ganges Valley\\nand central India were the areas under direct administrative control. Samudra Gupta\\nwas succeeded about 380 BC by his son Chandra Gupta II, though there is some\\nevidence that there may have been an intermediate ruler Ram Gupta. Chandra Gupta\\nII’s major campaign was against the Saka rulers of Ujjain, the success of which was\\ncelebrated in a series of silver coins. Gupta territory adjoining the northern Deccan\\nwas secured through a marriage alliance with the Vakataka dynasty, the successors\\nof the Satavahanas in the area. Although Chandra Gupta II took the title of\\nVikramaditya (Sun of Valour), his reign is associated more with cultural and intellec-\\ntual achievements than with military campaigns. His Chinese contemporary, Fa-hsien,\\na Buddhist monk, traveled in India and left an account of his impressions.\\n30.10 NATURE OF THE GUPTA STATE\\nFrom the reign of Chandragupta I onwards the Guptas took the title of Maharajadhiraj\\nas is known from inscriptions are Paramarajadhiraja, Rajadhirajashri,\\nRajarajadhiraja. In the Allahabad pillar inscription, Samudragupta is regarded as\\nGod living on earth. In the historical accounts he is referred to as Kuber, Indra etc.\\nHereditary succession was established in this period though the emperor chose the\\nheir apparent. Several powers conquered by the Guptas were allowed to function\\nindependently. They were subjugated conquered but not incorporated in the empire.\\nThese feudatories (servant like) paid tribute to the Guptas but at times some of them\\ndid not mention Guptas as their suzerain (controller of records) in their official records.\\nThe practice of land grants and also grants of villages under the Satvahanas contin-\\nued under the Guptas. These grants carried with them administrative rights which led\\nto the decentralization of administrative authority. Rights of subinfeudation (owner-\\nship) were given to the land donees (grant receivers). In central and western India,\\nthe villagers were also subjected to forced labour called Visti (forced labour) was\\napplied to all classes of subjects.\\n30.11 THE GUPTA  ADMINISTRATION\\nAdministratively, the Gupta state was divided into provinces called desa or bhukti, and\\nthese in turn into smaller units, the pradesa or visaya. The provinces were governed by\\nkumaramatyas, high imperial (royal) officers or members of the royal family. The shift\\nto smaller area of power of authority is evident from the composition of the municipal\\nboard (adhisthana-adhikarana), which consisted of the guild president (nagara-\\nsresthin), the chief merchant (sarthavaha), and representatives of the artisans and of\\nthe scribes. During this period the term samanta, which originally meant neighbour, was\\nbeginning to be applied to intermediaries who had been given grants of land or to con-\\nquered feudatory rulers. There was also a noticeable tendency for some of the higher\\nadministrative offices to become hereditary. The lack of firm control over conquered\\nareas led to their resuming independence. The repeated military action that this neces-\\nsitated may have strained the kingdom’s resources. The Gupta monarchs maintained a\\nstanding army.

The\\nstates consisted of areas administered directly by the rulers and the areas ruled by the\\nvassal chiefs who were autonomous governing themself in their internal affairs. The\\nvassals had a general obligation of loyalty, paying a fixed tribute and supplying a quota\\nof troops to the overlord.

The nucleus\\nof Chola power during the reign of Vijayalaya in the late ninth century was Thanjavur,\\nfrom which the Cholas spread northward, annexing in the tenth century what remained\\nof Pallava territory. To the south they came up against the Pandyas. Chola history can\\nbe reconstructed in considerable detail because of the vast number of lengthy inscrip-\\ntions issued not only by the royal family but also by temple authorities, village councils,\\nand trade guilds. Parantaka I (907–953) laid the foundation of the kingdom. He took the\\nnorthern boundary up to Nellore (Andhra Pradesh), where his advance was stopped by\\na defeat at the hands of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. Parantaka was more suc-\\ncessful in the south, where he defeated both the Pandyas and the Gangas. He also\\nlaunched an abortive attack on Sri Lanka. For thirty years after his death, there was a\\nseries of overlapping reigns that did not strengthen the Chola position. There then fol-\\nlowed two outstanding rulers who rapidly reinstated Chola power and ensured the king-\\ndom its supremacy. These were Rajaraja I and Rajendra.\\nRajaraja (985–1014) began establishing power with attacks against the Pandyas and\\nIllamandalam (Sri Lanka). Northern Sri Lanka became a province of the Chola king-\\ndom. A campaign against the Gangas and Calukyas extended the Chola boundary\\nnorth to the Tungabhadra River. On the eastern coast the Cholas battled with the\\nCalukyas for the possession of Vengi. A marriage alliance gave the Cholas an\\nauthoritative position, but Vengi remained a bone of contention. A naval campaign led\\nto the conquest of the Maldive Islands, the Malabar Coast, and northern Sri Lanka, all\\nof which were essential to the Chola control over trade with Southeast Asia and with\\n20\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nEARLY STATES\\nArabia and East Africa. These were the transit areas, ports of call for the Arab\\ntraders and ships to Southeast Asia and China, which were the source of the valuable\\nspices sold at a high profit to Europe.\\nRajaraja I’s son Rajendra participated in his father’s government from 1012, suc-\\nceeded him two years later, and ruled until 1044. To the north he annexed the Raichur\\nDoab and moved into Manyakheta in the heart of Chalukya territory. A revolt against\\nMahinda V of Sri Lanka gave Rajendra the excuse to conquer southern Sri Lanka as\\nwell. In 1021–22 the now-famous northern campaign was launched. The Chola army\\ncampaigned along the east coast as far as Bengal and then north to the Ganges\\nRiver- almost the exact reverse of Samudra Gupta’s campaign to Kanchipuram in the\\n4th century AD. The most spectacular campaign, however, was a naval campaign\\nagainst the Srivijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia in 1025. The reason for the assault on\\nSrivijaya and neighbouring areas appears to have been the interference with Indian\\nshipping and mercantile interests seeking direct trading connections with South China.\\nThe Chola victory reinstated these connections, and throughout the eleventh century\\nChola trading missions visited China.\\n30.14 EVOLUTION OF CHOLA ADMINISTRATION\\nThe Chola State during the imperial period (850-1200) was marked for its uniqueness\\nand innovativeness. Cholas were the first dynasty who tried to bring the entire South\\nIndia under a common rule and to a great extent succeeded in their efforts. Although\\nthe form and protocols of that government cannot be compared to a contemporary\\nform of government, the history of the Chola Empire belongs to a happy age in our\\nhistory, when in spite of much that appears to us as primitive, great things were\\nachieved by the government and the people.\\nThe king was the supreme commander and a benevolent dictator. His share in the\\nadministration consisted of issuing oral commands to responsible officers when rep-\\nresentations were made to him. Such orders were recorded in great detail in the\\ninscriptions, usually on the walls of temples. A special type of official, names\\nTirumandira Olai Nayagam who recorded the oral orders immediately on palm leaf\\nmanuscripts were responsible for the accurate.\\nThere is no definite evidence of the existence of a council of ministers or of other\\nofficers connected to the central government, though the names of individual ministers\\nare found in the inscriptions. A powerful bureaucracy assisted the king in the tasks of\\nadministration and in executing his orders. Due to the lack of a legislature or a legislative\\nsystem in the modern sense, the fairness of king’s orders dependent on the goodness of\\nthe man and in his belief in Dharma – sense of fairness and justice. The ancient society\\ndid not expect anything more than general security from the government. Even matters\\nof disputes went to the officers of the court only as the last resort.\\nThe Chola bureaucracy did not differ much from its contemporaries i.e others operating\\nduring the same tune. However, what distinguished it was its highly organized nature. A\\ncareful balance between central control and local independence was\\nmaintained and non-interference in local government was sacrosanct (very important).\\nThere was a definite hierarchy of the bureaucracy and the tenure of the officials simply\\ndependent on the ‘Crown’s pleasure’. The officials held various titles such as Marayan\\nand Adigarigal. Seniority between the same cadre was indicated by qualifying title\\nsuch as Perundanam and Sirutanam. One of the important officers were the Revenue\\nofficials responsible for the receipts and expenditures of the government.\\n21\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n EARLY  STATES\\nEvery village was a self governing unit. A number of such villages constituted a\\nKorram or nadu or Kottam in different parts of the country. Taniyur was a large\\nvillage big enough to be a Kurram by itself. A number of Kurrams constituted a\\nValanadu. Several Valanadus made up one Mandalam, a province. At the height of\\nthe Chola Empire there were eight or nine of these provinces including Sri Lanka.\\nThese divisions and names underwent constant changes throughout the Chola period.\\nAn inscription of the eighth century BC at Uttaramerur temple describes the consti-\\ntution of the local council, eligibility and disqualifications for the candidates, the method\\nselection, their duties and delimits their power. It appears that the administration of a\\ncommon village Ur or Oor was different from that of a village gifted to brahmins.\\nThe activities of the officials of the bureaucracy were under constant audit and scru-\\ntiny. We have an example of such reports in an inscription from the reign of Uththama\\nChola which gives us the details of the carelessness and neglect of some officials in\\nthe delay of recording a particular grant. As a result a dispute arose between con-\\ntending parties as to who should benefit from the grant. The officials involved were\\npunished. As the head of the civil administration, the king himself occasionally toured\\nthe country and carried out inquests into the local administration. An extensive resur-\\nvey was done around 1089 by the Chola king Kulottunga, recording the extents of\\nlands and their assessment, boundaries of villages and the common rights inside the\\nvillage, including the communal pastures. Revenue officials were responsible for the\\ntax collection. The Chola government was very mindful of the need for the fair and\\naccurate collection of tax to run the state machinery. The revenue records were not\\nmanuals of extortion (taking money unwillingly), but carefully maintained records of\\nland rights, based on complete enquired and accurate surveys, and were kept up-to-\\ndate by regular surveys. The duties of revenue officials included many other spheres\\nof responsibilities. They also regulated receipts and expenditures of temples. They\\nwere also seen to purchase land on behalf of village assemblies. They attested and\\ncertified important documents drawn up by local government agencies such as village\\ncouncils. They were also shown to act as magistrates. Besides the tax collected by\\nthe central government, several local bodies enjoyed the privilege of collecting tolls\\nand other imposts charges.\\nJustice was mostly a local matter in the Chola Empire, where minor disputes were\\nsettled at the village level. The punishments for minor crimes were in the form of\\nfines or a direction for the offender to donate to some charitable endowment (body or\\ninstitution). Even crimes such as manslaughter or murder were punished by fines.\\nCrimes of the state such as treason vebollown were heard and decided by the king\\nhimself and the typical punishment in such cases was either execution or confiscation\\nof property. Capital punishment was uncommon even in the cases of first-degree\\nmurder. Only one solitary instance of capital punishment is found in all the records\\navailable so far. Village assemblies exercised large powers in deciding local disputes.\\nSmall committees called Nyayattar heard matters that did not come under the\\njurisdiction of the voluntary village committees. The punishments in most cases were\\nin the form of donations to the temples or other endowments. The convicted person\\nwould remit their fines at a place called Darmaasana. There is not much information\\navailable on the judicial procedures or court records. There was no distinction\\nbetween civil and criminal offences. Sometimes civil disputes were allowed to drag\\non until time offered the solution. Crimes such as theft, adultery and forgery were\\nconsidered serious offences.

The existence of the state was primarily depen-\\ndent on two factors: danda (authority) and dharma.

The\\nAryans were divided into tribes, which had settled in different regions of north–west-\\nern India. Tribal chiefs bearing the little Raja or king were at first little more than\\nwar–lords and their principal duty was protection of their tribes.

The two major state formations discussed\\nhere are Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. The medieval rulers basically came\\nfrom outside India thus they had to influence as well as learn from native political\\nstructures. Medieval state may be characterized as a polity headed by a strong ruler,\\nsupported by hierarchically organized administrative machinery and legitimized by the\\nauthority of religion.  The army, bureaucracy by blood and land revenue remained the\\nbasic elements of the state. But each ruler had to balance the competing groups for\\npower sharing.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\n•\\nanalyse the evolution of state in medieval India;\\n•\\nrecall the nature of medieval state and\\n•\\nexplain the institutions of medieval state.\\n31.1 THE BACKGROUND\\nSince the decline of the Gupta state the Indian polity saw decentralization and rise\\nof various regional states. Transition from early to medieval period saw tripartite\\nstruggle among the three regional powers- Palas of Bengal, Pratiharas of northern\\nIndia and Rashtrakutas of Peninsular India. Very soon northern India saw the emer-\\ngence of Rajput small kings aspiring to become kingdoms. But the arrival of the\\nTurks from north western direction saw emergence of new process of an extended\\nmedieval state.\\n31.2 DELHI SULTANATE\\nIlbari Turks\\nIn the thirteenth century, a new kind of dynastic domain emerged in North India. The\\nDelhi Sultanate had its origin in victories by Muhammad Ghauri, who sacked Ghazni\\nin 1151, and then expelled Ghaznavids to Punjab, in1157. Muhammad Ghauri marched\\n25\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE MEDIEVAL STATE\\ninto the Indus basin to uproot the Ghaznavids in 1186. On the way, his armies\\nconquered Multan (1175), Sind (1182), Peshawar and Lahore (1186).  In 1190, he\\noccupied Bhatinda, which triggered battles with the Rajput King Prithviraj Chauhan,\\nwhom he finally defeated in 1192.  Having broken the Rajput hold on western\\nroutes to the Ganga basin, the Ghaurid armies marched eastward until Bakhtyar\\nKhalji finally defeated Laksmanasena in Bengal, in 1200. Muhammad Ghauri died\\nin 1206. His trusted Mamluk (ex–slave) general, Qutb–ud–din–Aibak, governor of\\nDelhi, then declared an independent rule. This dynasty of Ilbari Turks was the first\\nin a series that became collectively known as the Delhi Sultanate. Later Ghaurid\\nand Ghaznavid efforts to bring Delhi back into their fold were finally defeated by\\nthe Delhi Sultan Iltutmish in 1211–1236. Iltutmish must be regarded as the real\\nconsolidator of the Turkish conquests in north India. He gave the new state capital,\\nDelhi, a monarchical form of government and governing class. He introduced\\nIqta–grant of revenue from a territory in lieu of salary. He maintained a central\\narmy and introduced coins of Tanka (silver) and Jital (copper). The famous Qutub\\nMinar was completed during his reign. Iltutmish nominated his daughter Raziya\\n(Raziyyat–ud–Din) to be his successor. Still, the new state had enough internal\\nmomentum to survive severe factional disputes during the 10 years following\\nIltutmish’s death, when four of Iltutmish’s children or grandchildren were in turn\\nraised to the throne and deposed. This momentum was maintained largely through\\nthe efforts of Iltutmish’s personal slaves, who came to be known as the Forty\\n(Chihilgan), a political faction whose membership was characterized by talent and\\nby loyalty to the family of Iltutmish.  The political situation had changed by 1246,\\nwhen Ghiyas-ud-din Balban, a junior member of the Forty, had gained enough power\\nto attain a controlling position within the administration of the newest sultan, Nasir–\\nud–din Mahmud (reigned 1246–66). Balban, acting first as na’ib (deputy) to the\\nsultan and later as Sultan (reigned 1266-87), was the most important political figure\\nof his time. Balban stressed the special position of Sultan as ‘Shadow of God’ (Zill-\\nal–Allah) on earth. Balban emphasized courtly splendour, decorum and etiquette.\\nHe also believed in severe setting example punishments even to the nobles. Blaban’s\\nimmediate successors, however, were unable to manage either the administration\\nor the intergroup conflicts between the old Turkish nobility and the new forces, led\\nby the Khaljis; after a struggle between the two factions, Jalal-ud-din Firuz Khalji\\nassumed the sultanate in 1290.\\nThe Khaljis\\nThe Khaljis were not recognized by the older nobility as coming from pure Turkish\\nstock (although they were Turks), and their rise to power was aided by impatient\\noutsiders, some of them Indian-born Muslims, who might expect to enhance their\\npositions if the hold of the followers of Balban and the Forty were broken. To some\\nextent, then, the Khalji power seizure was a move toward the recognition of a\\nshifting balance of power, believed to be the result of both to the developments\\noutside the territory of the Delhi Sultanate, in Central Asia and Iran, and to the\\nchanges that followed the establishment of Turkish rule in northern India. Under\\nthe Khaljis external policy of conquest and internal methods of absolute control\\nwere followed through military expeditions and regulations. The Khaljis used their\\nAfghan descent to win the loyalties of the discontented nobles, who felt that they\\nhad been neglected by the earlier sultans.  Jalaluddin Khalji (1290 AD – 1296 AD)\\ntried to mitigate some of the harsh aspects of Balban’s rule.  He was the first ruler\\n26\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nto put forward the view that the state should be based on the willing support of the\\ngoverned and that since the majority of Indians were Hindus, the state cannot be\\ntruly Islamic.\\nIn 1296 he was assassinated by his ambitious nephew and successor, Ala–ud–\\nDin Khalji. During the reign of Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296–1316), the sultanate briefly\\nassumed the status of an empire.  In order to achieve his goals of centralization\\nand expansion, Ala-ud-din needed money, loyal and reasonably obeying nobility,\\nand an efficient army under his personal control. He had earlier, in 1292, partly\\nsolved the problem of money when he conducted a lucrative raid into Bhilsa in\\ncentral India. Using that success to build his position and a fresh army, he led a\\nbrilliant and unauthorized raid on the fabulously wealthy Devagiri (modern\\nDaulatabad), the capital of the Yadavas, in the Deccan early in 1296. The wealth\\nof Devagiri not only financed his usurpation but provided a good foundation of  his\\nstate-building plans. Centralization and heavy agrarian taxation were the princi-\\npal features of Ala-ud-din’s rule. The magnitude and mechanism of agrarian taxa-\\ntion enabled the sultan to achieve two important objectives: (1) to ensure supplies\\nat low prices to grain carriers, and (2) to fill the state granaries with a buffer\\nstock, which, linked with his famous price regulations, came as a solution to the\\ncritical financial problem of maintaining a large standing army.  Within five years\\nafter Ala–ud–din’s death (1316), the Khaljis lost their power. The succession\\ndispute resulted in the murder of Malik Kafur by the palace guards and in the\\nblinding of Ala-ud-din’s six-year-old son by Qutb-ud-din Mubarak shah, the Sultan’s\\nthird son, who assumed the sultanate (1316–20). He was murdered by his favourite\\ngeneral, a Hindu convert named Khusraw Khan. Opposition to Khusraw’s rule\\narose immediately, led by Ghazi Malik, the warden of the western marches at\\nDeopalpur, and Khusraw was defeated and slained after four months.\\nThe Tughluqs\\nGhazi Malik, who ascended the throne as Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq (reigned 1320–\\n25), had distinguished himself prior to his accession by his successful defense of\\nthe frontier against the Mongols. The Tughlaqs also wished to rule the whole of\\nIndia. Ghiyasuddin’s (1320–1325) campaign to Warangal, Orissa and Bengal were\\ndirected towards this end. He built the city Tughlaqabad near Delhi. While return-\\ning from the Bengal campaign, the Sultan was killed when a wooden shelter col-\\nlapsed on him at Afghanpur, near Delhi. The reign (1325–51) of Muhammad bin\\nTughlaq marked both the high point of the sultanate and the beginning of its decline.\\nThe period from 1296 to 1335 can be seen as one of nearly continuous centraliza-\\ntion and expansion. In  fourteeth century chronicle of Firuz Shah Tughluq’s reign in\\nDelhi, contemporary historian Ziauddin Barani said that, “history is the knowledge\\nof the annals i.e. the historical records and traditions of prophets, caliphs, sultans,\\nand great men of religion and government.” The Tughlaq dynasty ended soon after\\nthe Timur’s invasion but sultanage survived, though it was merely a shadow of its\\nformer self. Timur’s nominee captured Delhi and was proclaimed the new sultan\\nand the first of Sayyid Dynasty (1414 AD – 1451 AD), which was to rule the\\nearlier half of the fifteenth century.  Their rule was short-lived and confined to a\\nradius of some 200 miles around Delhi. They kept the machinery going until a more\\ncapable dynasty, the Lodhis, took over. The Lodhis were of pure Afghan origin, and\\nbrought an eclipse to the Turkish nobility.\\n27\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 31.1\\nCorrect the following sentences and rewrite:\\n1.\\nMuhammad Ghauri marched into the Indus basin to uproot the Ghaznavids\\nin 1168.\\n2.\\nGhauri’s armies conquered Multan in 1157, Sind in 1128 and Parkawas and\\nLahore in 1168.\\n3.\\nIltumish must be regarded as the real consolidator of the Turkish Conquests in\\nSouth India.\\n4.\\nAfter a struggle between the two factions Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khalji assumed the\\nsultanate in 1209.\\n5.\\nIn 1269 Jalaluddin Khalji was assassinated by his ambitious nephew and successor,\\nAla-ud-Din Khalji.\\n31.3 THE MUGHALS\\nIn 1526, Babur from Central Asia established Mughal dynasty in India. Babur claimed\\ndescend from both Timur and Genghis Khan.  His conquest of Delhi and Ganga basin\\nwas before the final step in the rise of warrior power in South Asia.  The greatest\\nsultans in South Asia were Mughal emperors who (though part Turk through Babur\\nand Timur) adopted Persian imperial culture and took the Persian title Padshah to lift\\nthemselves symbolically above Turks, Afghans, and all other sultans. Babur was a\\nChagatai Turk who fled patrimonial lands near Samarkand to escape Uzbek armies.\\nHe followed opportunity into the Ganga basin, where he used Uzbek-style fast-horse\\ntightly packed together cavalry equipped with muskets and canon to sweep away the\\nopposition.  In 1526, he had conquered sultans from Punjab to Bengal. But opposition\\nsurvived. Thirteen years later, an Afghan soldier who had fought for the Lodis and for\\nBabur, and who styled himself Sher Shah to demonstrate his Persian education (at\\nJaunpur), declared a new dynasty in Bengal and Bihar. Sher Shah’s armies then beat\\nBabur’s son, Humayun, back to Afghanistan, where Humanyan raised his own son,\\nAkbar, in exile. The Sur dynasty did not survive the Shah’s death, though its lasting\\naccomplishments included administrative innovations and a trunk road from Bengal to\\nPubjab. Soon after Sher Shah died, Humayun conquered Delhi, in 1555.  He died\\nthere by accident. His thirteen year old son, Akbar, then ascended his throne under\\nhis regent, Bairam Khan. Akbar was crowned in 1556, as Bairam Khan conquered\\nstrategic fortress cities at Lahore, Delhi, Agra, and Jaunpur. Bairam Khan had also\\nconquered Malwa and Rajsthan before he was ousted as regent and assassinated.\\nAkbar ruled for fifty years (1556- 1650). He continued to conquer to the end.\\n28\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nHis armies surpassed all before in there size, funding, leadership, technology, and\\nsuccess. At his death, his domains stretched from Kabul, Kashmir, and Punjab to\\nGujarat, Bengal, and Assam; and they were still increasing in the south and up into\\nmountains on all sides. His mantle was passed to his son, Jahangir (1605–1627) then\\nto his grandson, Shah Jahan (1627–1658), and to his great-grandson. Aurangzeb (1658–\\n1707), whose death was followed by imperial fragmentation.Though the dynasty\\nsurvived until 1858, when it was dethroned by the British. The Mughal Empire at its\\npeak commanded resources unprecedented in Indian history and covered almost the\\nentire subcontinent. Form 1556 to 1707, during the hey–day of its fabulous wealth and\\nglory, the Mughal Empire was a fairly efficient and centralized organization, with a\\nvast complex of personnel, money, and information dedicated to the dervice of the\\nemperor and hid nobility.\\nMuch of the empire’s expansion during this period was attributable to India’s growing\\ncommercial and cultural contact with the outside world. The sixteenth and seven-\\nteenth centuries brought the establishment and expansion of European and non-Euro-\\npean trading organizations in the subcontinent, principally for the procurement of\\nIndian goods in demand abroad, Indian regions drew close to each other by means of\\na dense overland and coastal trading network. Significantly incresining the internal\\nsurplus of precious metals. With expanded connections to the wider world came also\\nnew ideologies and technologies to challenge and enrich the imperial edifice. The\\nempire itself, however, was a purely Indian historical experience. Mughal culture\\nblended Perso-Islamic and regional Indian elements into a distinctive but variegated\\nwhole. Although by the early eighteenth century,  the regions had begun to reassert\\ntheir independent positions, the Mughal period outlasted imperial central authority.\\nThe imperial centre, in fact, came to be controlled by the direction of the Mughal\\nEmpire over its first 200 years (1526–1748) thus provides a fascinating illustration of\\npre–modern state building in the Indian subcontinent.\\n31.4 NATURE OF MEDIEVAL STATE\\nWhat did it mean to be a Sultan? In the Quran this Arabic word represent a man with\\nspiritual power. Mahmud of Ghazni was the first man to be styled “Sultan” by\\ncontemporaries, which indicates his success in cultivating admirers. The title seems\\nto have been popular first among Turks. Seljuq dynasties in Western and Central Asia\\nwere the to use this title of ‘Sultan’ routinely, and later, Ottoman Turks made it fa-\\nmous in Europe. When the Caliph began conferring the title, it spread quickly among\\nMuslim rulers and changed along the way. The Sultans of Delhi acknowledged the\\nsovereignty of Caliph of Baghdad and considered their kingdom as a part of Dar–ul–\\nIslam of which the Caliph was the juridical head. India under the Mughal emperors\\nwas governed under the Muslim law Sharia. Even so neither under the Sultans of\\nDelhi nor under the Mughal Emperors did the state confirm absolutely to Islamic\\nordinances since it had to adapt itself to the realities and often may not be the correct\\none. The Turkish and Afghan rulers of India had to treat the Hindus, who formed the\\nvast majority of the population, with consideration and toleration. In fields relating to\\nreligion, property and several other non- religious affairs, the non–Muslim population\\nwas allowed full freedom to have their cases tried by their own communal courts.\\nThe land revenue system under the Sultan and the ceremonies and the procedure at\\nthe royal court bear the unmistakable evidence of Indian tradition. The question arises\\nthat whether the medieval Indian state was government by priest? In formal sense\\n29\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nthe medieval state under the Muslim rule was definitely a theocracy, since it had all its\\nessential elements- the sovereignty of God and government by the direction of the\\nGod through priests in accordance with divine laws. The Sultans of Delhi considered\\nthemselves as deputies or assistants of the Caliph who was God’s representation.\\nSher Shah and Islam Shah assumed the title of Caliph and the Mughal Emperors,\\nfrom Akbar to Aurangzeb, adopted titled like ‘Shawdow of God’, and ‘Agent of God\\non earth’. The sovereignty of God was unquestioned. The supremacy of the Sharia\\nwas always acknowledged, though Akbar added to the Sharia the state laws. How-\\never, these rulers did not allow the Muslim divines to dictate the policies of the state.\\nBasically, defense, law and order and collection of revenue were the primary concerns\\nof the Sultanate of Delhi. In other matters, it generally followed a policy of non interfer-\\nence, as the welfare of the people was not the primary concern of the sultans.\\nToleration under the Sultans was the exception rather than the rule. Thus, while\\nclaiming to be Islamic the state of Delhi Sultanate was militaristic and aristocratic in\\ncharacter. In contrast the Mughal Empire stood on altogether different ground.\\nToleration and kindness were the guiding principles of Akbar’s government. Akbar\\nconsidered his subjects as his children and hence held himself responsible for their\\nwelfare. The state as conceived by Abul Fazl and established by Akbar was not con-\\nfined to any particular class and was based on the principle of ‘peace with all’ (Sulh-i-\\nKul). But in spite of Akbar’s enlightened policy and its circumstantial continuation by\\nJahangir and Shah Jahan, the Mughal rule had limited scope in its function. In spite of\\nimparting charities and kind Monarchs the Mughal state was not a welfare state.\\nExtraction of the land revenue and defense were its main functions. The form of gov-\\nernment was a Monarchy which in spite of being hereditary could not develop a well\\ndefined law of succession. Theoretically, the king was the fountainhead of all branches\\nof the government but weak persona of the ruler could provide the opportunity to the\\nnobility and the ulema to exercise effective check on the royal power.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 31.2\\nFill in the Blanks\\n1.\\nBabur claimed descend from both \\n and \\n.\\n2.\\nAfter Sher Shah Suri died, Humayun Conquered Delhi in \\n.\\n3.\\nFrom 1556 to \\n , during the hey–day of its fabulous wealth and glory\\nthe Mughal Empire was a \\n and \\n organization.\\n4\\nIndia under the \\n empire was governed under Muslim law\\n.\\n31.5 THE KINGSHIP\\nWhatever his title, a monarch was a man of personal greatness, not only as an army\\ncommander but as a spiritual and moral being. A man of civilization, his wars were\\ncivilizing, by definition, though what this meant varied and changed. A Sultan’s\\ngrandeur emerged from the work of people around him. Putting halos on Muslim\\nmonarchs was a job for poets, scholars (imams and ulema), architects, chroniclers,\\n30\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nbiographers, spiritual guides (sufis), and Friday prayer leaders at the Jama Masjid,\\nthe great congregational mosque essential in any domain. Skilled service providers\\nand cultural activists competed for the honors to glorify sultans, and in doing so the\\nSultan’s personality thus emerged in context. Experts and allies around him shaped\\nhis opinions, policies, and priorities. He cultivated people to secure his success; and\\nhis power depended on their power. Thus the social institution of a monarch’s  power\\nextended well beyond the throne. Early Sultans like Mahmud of Ghazni relied entirely\\non kin and close ethnic allies. As the political landscape became more complex, more\\ncomplex personalities developed and under the Mughals assumed epic proportions.\\nThe Sultan’s body, speech, piety, personal habits, hobbies, family. Household, ances-\\ntors, wives, son, and in-laws formed the inner core of his public identity; they ap-\\npeared in public gossip, art, lore, song, and chronicle.\\n31.6 THE ROYAL COURT\\nA daily dramatization of the Sultan’s public self occurred in his court. At his public\\ndarbar,  where he received guests, ambassadors, supplicants, allies, and payers of\\ntaxes and tribute.The institution of the darbar evolved over time. Its early Central\\nAsian home was a regal tent on the battlefield’ in later centuries, it acquired architec-\\ntural grandeur, as at the Mughal fort- cities in Fatehpur Sikri, Agra, and Delhi, whose\\ndarbar halls are massive stages for the emperor’s performance of power. Many\\ndarbars incorporated Hindu and Muslim traditions of display and drama. We have a\\ndetailed rendering of darbar scenes in eighteenth century paintings that now accom-\\npany the seventeenth century pardshahanama, the chronicle or the Mughal emperor\\nShah Jahan. These illustrations show hanging rugs that recall the darbar’s nomadic\\nheritage, and each and every person depicted in the paintings had a specific rank at\\ncourt and relation to the emperor. The darbar became a place for dramatizing in\\npublic all the personal  identities that were being defined in relation to sultans. To\\ndramatize all the various personalities of power that comprised his domain, a sultans,\\ntook his darbar wherever he went. A darbar spent considerable time on the move,\\nespecially in battle. The ruler’s traveling court became an enduring cultural phenom-\\nenon; and in later centuries, touring administrators, tax collectors, and politicians ef-\\nfectively became touring sultans of modern times.\\n31.7 PERSONA OF THE KING\\nA Sultan’s retinue(a group of retainers in attendance), regalia privileges & a king  and\\nfamily symbolized his greatness. Sultans were sticklers for public etiquette and lim-\\nited protocol, lest subordinates exceed their station. The sultan had to have the big-\\ngest, richest, most elaborate, extravagant, valuable things visible on his person, to\\ndramatize his ascendancy constantly. Vijayanagar Rayas styled themselves “Lords\\nof the Eastern and Western Oceans” by adorning their bodies with precious com-\\nmodities from overseas trade, specifically, perfumes and precious things like Chinese\\nporcelain. The Sultan’s home was a larger version of his own body and dramatized\\nhis power to accumulate, command, control, and define wealth, value and taste. The\\ngrandiose habits of consumption of the great influencer became an enduring fact of\\npolitical life in South Asia.\\nSignificant features of a Sultan’s persona emerged in publicly visible domestic\\ndramas, above all, marriage. Weddings were great events of political life because\\nmarriage was the most secure method of political alliance. In the padshahnama,\\nwarfare and weddings are depicted by the artists most elaborately. Even the Mughal\\n31\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nEmpire was at bade a family affair. In the inner secret deep inside area of the palace,\\nfamily members vied for influence and engaged in the secret plans that often culmi-\\nnated in wars of succession, in which relatives killed one another, as they did in the epic\\nMahabharata. At home, the Sultan’s honour rested on the stainless virtue of his mother,\\nwives, daughters, and sisters. Seperated from public view women of the palace lived\\nbehind a curtain, pardah; and women in seclusion, pardahnasheen, became the sultan’s\\nown virtue. Practices of female seclusion spread among elites who modeled them-\\nselves on sultans, Hindus and Muslims alike, at all levels of society.\\n31.8 THE NOBILITY\\nThe sultans looked different titles that indicate ethnic origins and cultural affiliations in\\naddition to marking personal status. Every Sultan sought to form and organize a group of\\nnobles which would be personally loyal to him. Thus not only the Turkan-i- Chihalgani\\n(Group of Forty nobles) tried to capture all privileges and power but groups having per-\\nsonal loyalty to Sultans like Qutbis (loyal to Qutub-ud- din Aibak), Shamsis (loyal to shams-\\nud-din Iltutmish), Balbanis and Alai amirs remained dominant throughout this period. Al-\\nmost all the high nobles, including the famous Forty in the thirteenth century, were of\\nCentral Asian origin; many of them were slaves purchased from the Central Asian ba-\\nzaars. The same phenomenon also led to the destabilization of the core of the Turkish\\nMamluks. With the Mongol plunder of Central Asia and eastern Iran, many more mem-\\nbers of the political and religious elite of these regions were thrown into north India,where\\nthey were admitted into various levels of the military and administrative cadre by the Delhi\\nSultans. Ala-ud-din was one of the first rulers to deliberately expand political participation\\nwithin the sultanate government. Not only did he partly open the gates to power for the\\nnon-Turkish Muslim nobility-some of whom were even converted Hindus within the politi-\\ncal world he viewed as legitimate. Both Ala-ud-din and his son married into the families of\\nimportant Hindu rulers, and several such rulers were received at court and treated with\\nrespect. Under the Tughluq, the non-Mumlim Indians rose to high and extremely respon-\\nsible officers, including the governorships of provices. Muhammad bin Tughluq was the\\nfirst Muslim ruler to planned efforts to induct Hindus into administration.\\nWithin the first three decades of Akbar’s reign, the imperial person of the highest class\\nhas grown enormously. As the Central Asian nobles had generally been nurtured on the\\nTurko – Mongol tradition of sharing power with the royalty – an arrangement not in tune\\nwith Akbar’s ambition of structuring the Mughal Centralism around himself – the\\nemperor’s principal goal was to reduce their strength and influence. The emperor en-\\ncouraged new elements to join his service, and Iranians came to form an important\\nblock of the Mughal nobility. Akbar also looked for new men of Indian background.\\nIndian Afghans, being the principal opponents of the Mughals, were obviously to be kept\\nat a distance; but the Sayyids of Baraha, the Bukhari Sayyids, and the Kambus among\\nthe Indian Muslims were specially favoured for high military and civil positions. More\\nsignificant was the recruitment of Hindu Rajput leaders into the Mughal nobility. This\\nwas a major step, even if not completely new in Indo – Islamic history, leading to a\\nstandard pattern of relationship between the Mughal autocracy and local cruel rulers.\\n31.9 OFFICES AND HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE\\nNeither the government of the Delhi Sultanate nor that of the Mughal Empire was\\nslave like. Both the governments were organized bureaucracy with regular gradation\\nof departments and officers. No officers, either civil or military, was hereditary and\\n32\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nthus the officers were appointed, transferred and dismissed by the Monarch at his will\\nand were accountable to him only. Under the Sultanate immediately after Sultan the\\noffice of Wazir was there to supervise all affairs of the government. The Mughals\\ncalled their Prime Minister as Wakil, later on synonymous with wazir or diwan. The\\nSultans established the Diwan–i–Arz (the Military Department) Headed by\\nAriz–i– Mumalik while under the Mughals Mir Bakshi was in–charge of army and\\ngeneral administration of royal establishment. In Sultanate religious affairs and charity\\nwere looked after by Diwan–i–Risalat headed by Sadr–us–Sudur (chief sadr). As\\nfar as the officer was concerned Mughals continued with the same title. Both the\\nregimes combined the office of Chief Qazi (Chief Justice) with that of sadr. In Sultan-\\nate Mushrif–i–Mamalik (Accountant General), Mushaufi–i–Mamalik (Auditor Gen-\\neral), Diwan–i–Insha (State Correspondence Department) headed by Dabir–i–Khas\\nand Barid–i–Mumalik (Head of the Intelligence Department) were some important\\noffices and departments.\\n31.10 PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION\\nUnder the Sultanate muqtis or walis were  in –change of the provinces. Provinces also\\nhad a Sahib–i–diwan assisted by mutasarrifs and karkuns to control income and expen-\\nditure in the end of the thirteenth century Shiqq emerged as an administrative division\\nlater known as Sarkar as well. For justice courts of the Qazi and the Sadr functioned in\\nthe provinces. The Mughal empire was divided into 15 provinces–Allahabad, Agra,\\nAvadh, Ajmer, Ahmadabad, Bihar, Bengal, Delhi, Kabul, Lahore, Multan, Malka,\\nQhandesh, Berar, and Ahmadnagar. Kashmir and Qandahar were districts of the prov-\\nince of Kabul, Sindh, then known as Thatta, was a district in the province of Multan.\\nOrissa formed a part of Bengal. The provinces were not of uniform area or income.\\nThere were in each province a governor, a dewan (revenue and finance officer), a\\nbakhshi (military commander), a sadr (religious administrator), and qazi (judge) and\\nagents who supplied information to the central government. Separation of powers among\\nthe various officials (in particular, between the governor and the diwan) was a\\nsignificant operating principal in imperial administration. The Mughal provinces were\\nalso divided into districts (sarkars). Each district had a faujdar (a military officer whose\\nduties roughly corresponded to those of a collector); a qazi, a bitikchi (head clerk); and\\na khazanedar (treasurer). Justice was administered by a hierarchy of courts rising from\\nvillage panchayat to the pargana, sarkar and provincial courts (under the Qazi,\\nAmir–i– Dad and Mir Adl) and finally to the chief sadr cum qazi and ultimately the\\nemperor himself. Both under Sultanate and Mughal, the Kotwal was the enforcer of\\nlaw at the local level.\\n31.11 IQTA, JAGIR AND MANSAB\\nIqta under the Sultanate and Jagir under the Mughals were developed as the officers\\nfor the collection of revenue which Iqtadars or jagirdars realized on behalf of the state\\nwith a view to obtain their salary. But their judicial preview over hand depended on the\\npleasure of the emperor. The muqtis or iqta holders were required to furnish military\\nassistance to the Sultans in times of need, apart from maintaining law and order and\\ncollecting the revenue from their iqta. These revenue assignments were generally\\nnon–hereditary and transferable. Similarly, the Mansab system was based upon the\\norganization of the public services of the Mughal Empire. It was neither hereditary nor\\nhierarchical. Mansab means literally a rank or a position which was fixed according to\\n33\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n THE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nthe personal merit and status (zat) of the officer and the contingent (sawar) he\\nmaintained. Generally, the mansabdars were assigned a territory known as a jagir, who’s\\nestimated revenue (Jama) was equal to the pay due for both their zat and sawar mansabs,\\nthough some mansabdars were also paid in cash from the imperial treasury.\\n31.12 TAXATION\\nThe system of taxation in Sutanate comprised taxes like Kharaj (varied from one\\nsixth to one third of the gross produce), Jaziya (levied upon adult non- Muslim males\\nwith independent means of maintenance in lieu of military service), Zakat (a tax\\nraised from well to do Muslims for the purpose of charity), Khams or Ghaninah (the\\nbooty taken in war) and other transit and octroi duties along with natural resources\\nwere the main sources of income. The chaudhuris, muqqadams and khuts were the\\nvillage revenue collector functioning under the amils, shiqdars and provincial muqtis.\\nKhalisa land revenue was reserved for the Sultan’s treasury only. The Mughals\\nimproved upon this system particularly in the area of land revenue. The system of\\nmeasurement zabt introduced by Sher Shah Suri was adopted and improved by Akbar.\\nUltimately, Ain–i–Dahsala the final method of revenue settlement was based upon\\nthe average annual yied of the previous ten years from a particular field. The\\nGaz–i– Ilahi, a new yard for land measurement brought uniformity in the land survey.\\nProductivity of the land, nature of the crop, prices, and irrigation facilities were the\\nother major factors deciding the cash value of the revenue demand of the govern-\\nment. Option of paying land tax could be done through various systems. Ownership\\nof the land always belonged to the cultivator.\\n31.13 ARMY\\nBoth the Sultanate and the Mughal state were dependent on army whose main strength\\nwas the cavalry. Ariz–i–Mumalik under the Sultans and Mir Bakshi under the Mughal\\nEmperors were the officers in – charge but the ruler himself commanded all the armed\\nforces. Balban was the first one to recruit a regular standing army, this system was\\nfurther strengthened by Ala–ud–din–Khalji who introduced the branding system (Dagh)\\nof the horses. The royal cavalry in Delhi Sultanate was called Hasham–i–Qalb or\\nAfwaj–i–Qalb. Hasham–i–Atraj was the cavalry posted at provincial level. This army\\nwas organized on the basis of decimal system. Mughal army was organized on the basis\\nof mansab system, described above. Ahadis were the royal troopers directly under the\\ncommand of the emperor. The artillery had developed rapidly in India after the advent\\nof Babur. Apart from siege i.e. the process of surrounding and attacking a fortified\\nplace there were heavy guns mounted on forts. The infantry, though numerous,\\nconsisted of both fighting and non- fighting classes. The fighting men were mainly\\nmatchlock men, called banduqchis. By the time of Akbar, matchlock contingent was\\nalso included in the infantry. Both Sultans of Delhi and Mughals used elephants on the\\nbattle fields. Navy always remained a weak point of the Indian rulers.\\n31.14 CURRENCY SYSTEM\\nThe standard coin under the Sultans from Iltutmish onwards was the silver tanka\\nweighing 175grains. The currency system was, however, bimetallic, there being\\nparallel coin in copper, the basic unit of which was the jital. In the fourteenth century,\\n48 or 50 jitals were held equal in worth to tanka. The Sultans issued bullion coins as\\n34\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nTHE MEDIEVAL STATE\\nwell, and gold issues have also survived. The Lodis, who never minted silver, issued a\\nheavy bullion coin 145 grains called bahloli. Sher Shah Suri established a bimetallic\\nsystem by issuing a rupee of silver and making the tanka a purely copper coin. The\\nMughals from Akbar onwards continued the same system: their rupee weighed 178\\ngrains (180 under Aurangzeb), and the alloy in these never rose above 4 per cent. In\\ncopper they minted dams of 323 grains each, these being originally the half tanka of\\nSher Shah. In the last years of Akbar, a rupee fetched 40 dams, and this became\\nsubsequently the paper value of the rupee. In fact, the copper price of the rupee\\ndeclined throughout the seventeenth century. The Mughals also issued gold coins,\\nknown as mohur or asharfi, but these were not normally used in the market. The Mughal\\ncoinage was of great metallic purity and uniformity. The minting was ‘free’ in the sense\\nthat any one could take bullion to the mint and get in coined at a small charge.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 31.3\\nFill in the blanks with appropriate word from the bracket\\n1.\\nThe emperor encouraged new elements to join his service, and \\ncame to form an important block of the Mughal normality.

After Sher Shah’s death Humayun conquered Delhi in 1555 and died\\nby accident.

The political authority of the colonial state gathered upon many instru-\\nments for preserving and enforcing its power which was a pre- condition for the\\nformulation of the colonial policy. It is important to know that how the rule over people\\nwas legitimized and how was the power of the colonial state made visible to the\\ncommon people subjected to foreign rule.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you would be able to:\\n•\\nunderstand the meaning and nature of the colonial state;\\n•\\nrecall the colonial objectives in India;\\n•\\nidentify the instruments of colonial control and\\n•\\nexplore the symbols and effects of the colonial rule\\n32.1 THE  BACKGROUND\\nThe Mughal Empire declined in the first half of the eighteenth century. The political\\nvacuum was filled by the rise of regional states like Bengal, Hyderabad, Awadh,\\nPunjab and Maratha Kingdom. But these regional powers could not provide political\\nstability resulting into a shameless chance for the British East India Company to\\nestablish a territorial empire in India. Now a set of institutions and regulations were\\nrequired to govern India through colonial machinery.\\n(i) Meaning of Colonial State\\nPrior to the British conquest, relations between regional people and the sovereign\\npower had never been defined wholly by religion. A web of economic and social\\nrelationship had survived periods of imperial consolidation, crisis and collapse, to bind\\nthe subcontinent into a loosely layered framework of interdependence. Despite a long\\nhistory of creatively accommodating multiple levels of supreme powers, the\\nrenegotiation of the terms for sharing power in an independent India saw the special\\nopportunity of a rigid and massive conception of territorial sovereignty based on a\\n38\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCOLONIAL  STATE\\nsingular and gathering together idea of the ‘nation’. The colonial state means the\\nassumption of sovereignty (legally independent power to govern and control) of a coun-\\ntry by a foreign political entity. The colonial state has to design a theory of sovereignty in\\nthe special context of the imperial-colonial relationship. This is done through a two way\\nprocess (1) process of legitimization of the colonial state i.e. justification of the legal\\nexistence of a foreign entity, which automatically leads to the second process i.e. (2) the\\nsubversion of delegitimization of pre-colonial indigenous political authority.\\n(ii) Nature of Colonial State\\nThe British consolidated their Colonial regime in India according to their ideas of what\\na colonial state could be and a modern state with some modern characteristics emerged.\\nAs in a modern state, the colonial government had a monopoly of force, a centralized\\nadministration for tax – collection, a centralized legal system, a professional staff of\\nadministrators and bureaucrats, and clearly defined territorial boundaries. British co-\\nlonial administrators aimed for a rule based on law, administered according to regula-\\ntions. At the lowest levels, however, where policy implementation took place, the ties\\nof caste, clan and kinship and patron-client relations played major roles in how the\\ncolonial state affected local society. After Independence in 1947, the new nation built\\nits government on institutions inherited form the colonial, with all of their strengths and\\ntheir weaknesses.\\n(iii) Colonial Objectives in India\\nIn the course of the 19th century a British royal or imperial ideology emerged in which\\nthe British, as the wealthiest and most progressive nation in the world, had a duty to help\\nrest of the world to prosper and improve. The rule of law would create the conditions\\nfor civilized living and the creation of wealth. In India the governing ideology was:\\n1.\\nIndians were not capable of governing themselves.\\n2.\\nBritain had the duty to supply good government which would be based on the rule\\nof law, without interfering in or attempting to manage Indian economy and society.\\nThe main responsibilities of imperial government were seen as:\\na)\\nCollecting land revenue and   b)\\nExecution of legal administration.\\nThe type of revenue settlement which the East India Company made, varied accord-\\ning to the prevailing ideology of how to create wealth in India, according to the\\nCompany’s security needs and according to experience which the Company gained\\nas new areas came under its control.\\nThe colonial state was working with two aims (1) the complete subordination of the\\nIndian colony to needs of British metropolis and (2) economic exploitation of the\\nIndian colony or the appropriation of the colonies economic surplus by the British\\nmetropolis. But the nature of the imperial interests in Indian did not remain the same\\nthrough-out and it changed according to the requirements of the Mother country and\\nin interest of the different social group in Britain. During the first stage of British rule\\nin India till 1813, British interests lay mainly in (i) the East India Company’s monopoly\\nof trade with India, and the elimination of other European competitors, (ii) the control\\nover financial resources, through taxation.\\nBoth these objectives could be fulfilled without having to disturb the existing institu-\\ntions and administrative apparatus. British rulers at this stage were not very different\\nfrom that of traditional rulers, interested mainly in receiving agricultural surplus.\\n39\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n COLONIAL  STATE\\nNo attempt was, therefore, made to create a uniform administrative structure or even to\\nrenovate the old one at this stage. No basic changes were introduced in the judicial system\\nand administration. Whatever little changes were made in the field of administration were\\nonly made at the top of the revenue collection and were linked to the objective of smooth\\nrevenue collection. A modern judicial system or uniform administrative structure for India\\nwas not seen as necessary at this stage, since it was not considered relevant for the\\nfulfillment of British objective during the first stage of British rule in India.\\nThis scenario changed considerably after 1813. The British economy and society\\nwere going through a major transformation, caused mainly by the Industrial revolu-\\ntion. The commercial trading corporations were now giving way to industrial owner-\\nship which had become the dominant force in the British society. The East India\\nCompany was gradually losing its monopoly over Indian trade. The British interests in\\nIndia no longer represented the interests of the Company but of the industrial capital-\\nist class. The interest of the British industrialists lay in using India as (a) a market for\\ntheir manufactured industrial goods, (b) a source of raw material like (jute, cotton\\netc.) for their industries and food grains, opium etc. for export.\\nAll this required much greater penetration into the India economy and society and\\ncontrol over India trade not only with British but with other countries also. India was\\nnow expected to play a new role. It was perhaps not possible to perform the new role\\nwith the traditional administrative institutions. They had to be changed and trans-\\nformed to suit the new requirements. Thus started the process of transforming Indian\\nadministration. Similarly, the entire legal structure had to be overhauled to promote\\nmodern business, create a market economy, free commercial relations and to regulate\\nthe various economic transactions smoothly with the help of modern laws.\\nBritish interests were of several kinds. At first the main purpose was to achieve a\\nmonopolistic trading position. Later, it was felt that a regime of free trade would make\\nIndia a major market for British goods and a source of raw materials, but British\\ncapitalists who invest in India, or who sold banking or shipping service there, contin-\\nued effectively to enjoy controlling or dominating privileges. India also provided inter-\\nesting and lucrative employment for a sizeable portion of the British upper middle\\nclass, and the remittances they sent home made an appreciable contribution to Britain’s\\nbalance of payment and capacity to save. Finally, control of India was a key element\\nin the world power structure, in terms of geography, logistics and military manpower.\\nThe British were not averse to India economic development if it increased their mar-\\nkets but refused to help in areas where they felt there was conflict with their own\\neconomic interests or political security. Hence, they refused to give protection to the\\nIndian textile industry until its main competitor became Japan rather than Manchester,\\nand they did almost nothing to further technical education. They introduced some\\nBritish concepts of property, but did not push them too far when they met interests.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 32.1\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1.\\nThe Mughal Empire declined in the first half of the \\n century.\\n2.\\nDuring the 1st stage of British rule in India till \\n British interests lay\\nmainly in the East India Company’s monopoly of trade with India.\\n40\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCOLONIAL  STATE\\n3.\\nThe British economy and society were going through a major transformation,\\ncaused mainly by the \\n revolution.\\n4.\\nThe interests of the British industrialist lay in using India as a market for their\\n goods.\\n32.2 FORMS OF LEGITIMACY\\nAs you know, immediately before the British rule the Indian sovereignty was lying\\nwith the Mughal dynasty. Till the early nineteenth century the British did not interfere\\nwith the symbols of kingship of the Mughal dynasty. By 1835 Persian remained the\\nofficial language and name of the Mughal emperors kept on appearing on coins. The\\nhighest gun salute was reserved for the Mughal dynasty only till 1837. Withdrawal of\\nthese symbols of sovereignty was a symbolic act on the part of the British East India\\nCompany signifying that it had captured the sovereignty of India. The Prior Presence\\nof the British in the presidency capitals and then in chosen inland locations, meant that\\nthe institutions which were to be the shorthand symbols of the empire would also be\\nbuilt in this order. Thus the island of Mumbai and some villages of the Hooghly delta\\nbecame the grand capitals of the company’s Bombay Presidency, and then the Indian\\nempire. The advanced, sophisticated heartland of the Mughal Empire became the\\nprovincial interior. The re-inscription of centre and periphery was done with the tools\\nof a new architecture. New institutions marked a new power. Buildings were the\\nmost corporeal or physical, material, and impressive forms of the new institutions.\\nWhat was visible in the capital city, say, in Bombay, was exactly what the provincial\\ntown lacked in the second half of the nineteenth century.\\nThe Company (itself a servant of British crown, running its affair through an Imperial\\ncharter) wanted to make the Indian emperor a subordinate. The terminology of sub-\\nFig. 32.1 Writers Building\\n41\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n COLONIAL  STATE\\nordination included ‘paramountcy’, ‘Protection’, ‘subsidiary alliance’, ‘indirect rule’,\\n‘collaboration’, drawn mainly from British experience in India. By the beginning of\\nthe nineteenth century ‘protection’ arrangements were established through a series\\nof treaties between the Company and various Indian Princely States. Governor Gen-\\neral Lord Wellesely prepared a system which came to be known as Subsidiary Alli-\\nance System. This system enlisted in quick succession Hyderabad (1798), the Maratha\\nPeshwa (1802), the Bhonsle of Nagpur the Scindia of Gualior (1803), Jaipur (1803),\\nthe Gaekwads of Baroda (1805), Travancore (1805), Cochin (1807), Kota (1817),\\nJodhpur (1818), Bikaner (1828). The essence of the system was the assurance of the\\nBritish protection which the native state paid for by or more of the following means\\n(a) cost of maintaining a contingent of Company’s troop in cash, (b) cession of the\\npart of the state’s territory to the Company,(c) partial or complete demilitarization i.e.\\ndoing away with armed force of the state, (d) restriction on relation with other politi-\\ncal powers and warfare without the Company’s approval, (e) acceptance of the\\nCompany’s Resident at the court to offer advice and instructions.\\nOnce the subjection was achieved through coercion, state practices had to be made\\nvisible to all the subjects. The practices adopted for visibility of the colonial state were\\nlike the trial of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar in his own palace in\\n1858 or the Delhi Durbar of 1877 when Indian subordination to the British sovereign\\nwas publicly enacted. The symbolic cultural construction of the colonial state for the\\ncommon masses was done through the remote agencies of the state and everyday\\nexperiences- the daroga and constabulary; the patel, the amin, the patwari and the\\nquanungo, in the Collector’s cutchery; the new court of law where unknown people\\nwearing black gowns, speaking an unknown language (English) taking decisions in\\nfavour of the powerful, the massive colonial monuments making colonial power vis-\\nible in the cities, the occasional sights of soldiers coming out of the cantonments on\\nflag march and ultimately the sight of the native social superior bowing and bending to\\nmembers of the white race were few symbols making images of the colonial rule in\\nthe Indian mindset.\\n32.3 BEGINNING OF THE COLONIAL CONTROL\\nDuring the Initial phase of colonial control, indigenous civil administrator was contin-\\nued with. This arrangement worked reasonably well before the conquest of Bengal,\\nbut was inefficient as a way of remunerating the officials of a substantial territorial\\nEmpire because (a) too much of the profit went into private hands rather than the\\nCompany’s coffers, and (b) an over greedy short-term policy was damaging to the\\nproductive capacity of the economy and likely to drive the local population to revolt,\\nboth of which were against the Company’s longer-term interests. Clive had operated\\na ‘dual’ system, i.e. Company power and a puppet Naweb. Warren Hastings dis-\\nplaced the Nawab and took over direct administration, but retained Indian officials.\\n32.4 BELIEF IDEOLOGY AND IDEOLOGUES OF COLONIALISM\\nThere was a strong streak of Benthamite radicalism in the East India Company ad-\\nministration. James Mill became a senior company official in 1819 after writing a\\nmonumental history of India which showed a strong contempt for Indian institutions.\\nFrom 1831 to 1836 he was the Chief Executive Officer of the East India Company\\nand his son John Stuart Mill worked for the Company from 1823 to 1858. Malthus\\nwas professor of economics at Haileybury, and the teaching there for future company\\nofficials was strongly influenced by Utilitarianism. Bentham himself was also\\n42\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCOLONIAL  STATE\\nconsulted on the reform of Indian institutions. The Utilitarians deliberately used India\\nto try out experiments and ideas (e.g. competitive entry for the civil service) which\\nthey would have liked to apply in England. The Utilitarians were strong supporters of\\nlaissez-faire and hated any kind of state interference to promote economic develop-\\nment. Thus, they tended to rely on market forces to deal with famine problems, they\\ndid nothing to stimulate agriculture or protect industry. This laissez-faire tradition was\\nmore deeply embedded in the Indian civil service than in the England itself, and\\npersisted very strongly until the late 1920s. The administration was efficient and non\\ncorrupt, but the state apparatus was of a watchdog character with few development\\nspending was for the military, justice, police and jails, and less than 3 per cent for\\nagriculture. One of the most significant things the British did to Westernize India was\\nto introduce a modified version of English education. Macaulay’s 1835 Minute on\\nEducation had a decisive impact on British educational policy and is a classic example\\nof a Western rationalist approach to Indian civilization. Before the British took over,\\nthe Court language of the Mughals was Persian and the Muslim population used\\nUrdu, a mixture of Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit. Higher education was largely\\nreligious and stressed knowledge of Arabic and Sanskrit. The Company had given\\nsome financial support to a Calcutta Madrassa (1718) and a Sanskrit college at Benares\\n(1792), Warren Hastings, as governor general from 1782 to 1795 had himself learned\\nSanskrit and Persian, and several other Company officials were oriental scholars.\\nOne of them, Sir William Jones, had translated a great mass of Sanskrit literature and\\nhad founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1785.\\nBut Macaulay was strongly opposed to this orientalism, “I believe that the present\\nsystem tends, not to accelerate the progress of truth, but to delay the natural death of\\nexpiring errors. We are a Board for wasting public money, for printing books which\\nare less value than the paper in which they are printed was while it was blank; for\\ngiving artificial encouragement to absurd history, absurd metaphysics, absurd physics,\\nabsurd theology ... But I have no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic … But I\\nhave done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value … Who could deny\\nthat a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of\\nIndia and Arabic ... all the historical information which has been collected from all the\\nbooks written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the\\nmost paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England”.\\nFor these reasons Macaulay had no hesitation in  deciding in favour of English education,\\nbut it was not to be for the masses, “It is impossible for us, with our limited means to\\nattempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class\\nwho may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons,\\nIndian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in mind. To that\\nclass we may leave it to refine the local dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with\\nterms of science borrowed from the Western name, and to render them by degrees, fit\\nvehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population”.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 32.2\\nTick out () whichever in correct:\\n1.\\nBy \\n Persian remained the official symbol of the Mughal dynasty.\\n(1831, 1833, 1835)\\n43\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n COLONIAL  STATE\\n2.\\nWhat was visible in the capital city, say , in Bombay was exactly what the provin-\\ncial town lacked in the second half of the \\n century.

All high-level posts were\\nreserved for the British , and Indians were excluded. Cornwallis appointed British\\njudges, and established British officials as revenue collectors and magistrates in each\\ndistrict of Bengal. From 1806 the Company trained its young recruits in Haileybury\\nCollege near London. Appointments were still organized on a system of patronage,\\nbut after 1833 the Company selected amongst its nominated candidates by competi-\\ntive examination. After 1853, selection was entirely on merit and the examination was\\nthrown open to any British candidate. The examination system was influenced by the\\nChinese model, which had worked well for 2,000 years and had a similar emphasis on\\nclassical learning and literary competence. The Indian civil service (i) was very highly\\npaid; (ii) it enjoyed political power which no bureaucrat could have had in England.\\nIn 1829 the system was strengthened by establishing districts throughout British India\\nsmall enough to be effectively controlled by an individual British official who hence-\\nforth exercised a completely autocratic power, acting as revenue collector, judge and\\nchief of police (functions which had been separate under the Mughal administration).\\nThis arrangement later became the cornerstone of imperial administration throughout\\nthe British Empire. As the civil service was ultimately subject to the control of the\\nBritish parliament, and the British community in India was subject to close mutual\\nsurveillance, the administration was virtually incorruptible.\\nThe army of the Company was a local mercenary force with 20,000- 30,000 British\\nofficers and troops. It was by far the most modern and efficient army in Asia. After\\nthe Mutiny in 1857, the size of the British contingent was raised to a third of the total\\nFig. 32.2 steam Engine\\n44\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCOLONIAL  STATE\\nstrength and all officers were British until the 1920s when a very small number of\\nIndians were recruited. Normally, the total strength of the army was about 200,000.\\nthis army was very much smaller than those of Mughal India, but had better training\\nand equipment, and the railway network (which was constructed partly for military\\nreasons) gave it greater mobility, better logistics and intelligence.\\nThe higher ranks of the administration remained almost entirely British until the 1920s\\nwhen the Indian Civil Services Examinations began to be held in India as well as\\nEngland. In addition, there was a whole hierarchy of separate bureaucracies in which\\nthe higher rank were British, i.e. the revenue, justice, police, education, medical,\\npublic works, engineering, postal and railway services as well as provincial civil\\nservices, India thus offered highly-paid careers to an appreciable portion of the\\nBritish middle and upper classes (particularly for its peripheral members from\\nScotland and Ireland).\\nFrom the 1820s to the 1850s the British demonstrated a strong urge to change Indian\\nsocial institutions, and to westernize India. They stamped out infant killing and ritual\\nburning of widows (sati). They abolished slavery and eliminated dacoits (religious\\nthugs) from the highways. They legalized the remarriage of widows and allowed\\nHindu converts to Christianity to lay claim to their share of joint family property. They\\ntook steps to introduce a penal code ( the code was actually introduced in 1861) based\\nin British law, which helped inculcate some ideas of equality. Under the new law,\\nBrahmin and Sudra were liable to the same punishment for the same offence. Thus\\nrule of law and equality before law were the new norms.\\nUntil 1857 it was possible to entertain the view that the British may eventually destroy\\ntraditional Indian society and westernize the country. But activist Westernizing poli-\\ncies and the attempt to extend British rule by taking over native states rulers had left\\nno heirs provokes sections of both the Hindu and Muslim communities into rebellion in\\nthe Mutiny of 1857. Although the Mutiny was successfully put down with substantial\\nhelp from loyal Indian troops including the recently conquered Sikhs, British policy\\ntowards Indian institutions and society became much more conservative. The Crown\\ntook over direct responsibility and the East India Company was disbanded. The In-\\ndian Civil Service attracted fewer people with innovating ideas than had the East\\nIndia Company and was more closely controlled from London.\\nThe British forged an alliance with the remaining native princes and stopped taking\\nover new territory. Until the end of their rule about a quarter of the Indian population\\nremained in quasi autonomous native states. These had official British residents but\\nwere fairly free in internal policy, and the effort of westernization came to a standstill.\\nThe education system which developed was a very pale reflection of that in the\\nUnited Kingdom. Three universities were set up in 1857 in Calcutta, Madras and\\nBombay, but they were merely examining bodies and did no teaching. Higher educa-\\ntion was carried out in affiliated colleges which gave a two-year B.A. course with\\nheavy emphasis on rote learning and examinations. Drop-out ratios were always very\\nhigh. They did little to promote analytic capacity or independent thinking and pro-\\nduced a group of graduates with a half-baked knowledge of English, but sufficiently\\nwesternized to be alienated from their own culture. It was not until the 1920s that\\nIndian universities provided teaching facilities and then only for M.A. student. Fur-\\nthermore, Indian education was of a predominantly literacy character and the provi-\\nsion for technical training was much less than in any European country. Education for\\n45\\nMODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n COLONIAL  STATE\\ngirls was almost totally ignored throughout the nineteenth century. Because higher\\neducation was in English, there was no official effort to translate western literature\\ninto the local nor was there any standardization of Indian scripts whose variety is a\\nmajor barrier to multi-lingualism amongst educated Indians.\\nPrimary education was not taken very seriously as government obligation and was\\nfinanced largely by the weak local authorities. As a result, the great mass of the\\npopulation had no access to education and, at independence in 1947, 88 per cent were\\nilliterate. Progress was accelerated from the 1930s onwards, but at independence\\nonly a fifth of children were receiving any primary schooling. Education could have\\nplayed a major role in encouraging social mobility, eliminating religious superstition,\\nincreasing productivity, and uplifting the status of women. In stead it was used to turn\\ntiny elite into imitation Englishmen and somewhat bigger group into government clerks.\\n32.6 CHANGES UNDER COLONIAL STATE\\nThe main changes which the British made in Indian society were at the top. They\\nreplaced the wasteful warlord nobility by a bureaucratic-military establishment, care-\\nfully designed by practical technocrats, which was very efficient in maintaining law\\nand order. The greater efficiency of government permitted a great reduction in the\\nfiscal burden, and a biggest share of the national product was available for landlords,\\ncapitalists and the new professional classes. Some of this upper class income was\\nsent off to the United Kingdom, but the bulk was spent in India. However, the pattern\\nof consumption changed as the new upper class no longer kept harems and palaces,\\nnor did they wear fine muslins and well decorated swords. This caused some painful\\nreadjustments in the traditional handicraft sector. Government itself carried out pro-\\nductive investment in railways and irrigation and as a result there was a growth in\\nboth agricultural and industrial output. The new elite established a western life-style\\nusing the English language and English schools. New towns and urban amenities\\nwere created with segregated suburbs and housing for them. Their habits were cop-\\nied by the new professional elite of lawyers, doctors, teachers, journalists and busi-\\nnessmen. Within this group, old caste barriers were eased and social mobility in-\\ncreased. As far as the mass of the population were concerned, colonial rule brought\\nfew significant changes. The British educational effort was very limited. There were\\nno major changes in village society, in the caste system, the position of untouchables,\\nthe joint family system, or in the production techniques in agriculture. British impact\\non economic and social development was, therefore, limited. Total output and popula-\\ntion increased substantially but the gain in per capita output was small or negligible.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 32.3\\nFill in the Blanks:\\n1.\\nAll high level posts were reserved for the British and Indians were \\n.\\n2.\\nAs the civil service was ultimately subject to the control of the British\\n, and the British community in India was subject to close mutual\\nsurveillance, the administration was \\n.\\n3.\\nThe British army was very much \\n than those of Mughal India, but\\nhad better training and \\n.\\n46\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6A\\nEvolution of State in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCOLONIAL  STATE\\n4.\\nThe \\n took over direct responsibility and the East India Company was\\n.\\nThe British state in India developed its own ethos.

You would probably find it impossible to survive unless you learned\\ntheir ways of behaviour. These ways of behaviour, along with many other things, go\\ninto the making of our culture.\\nAs you will see, all of us are born into cultures. This may differ according to our\\nregion, religion and caste or class. As we grow, each one of us absorbs dozens of\\ncultural practices almost automatically. Many of these practices have been handed\\ndown for generations, some of these for centuries, and some are even millennia old\\ntraditions. At the same time, cultural practices are subject to change. In this lesson,\\nwe will explore our relationship to culture.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson,  you will be able to:\\n•\\ndefine culture;\\n•\\nanalyse how culture is shaped;\\n•\\nexplain cultural interaction and\\n•\\ncritically analyze phenomenon of globalisation.\\n29.1 WHAT DO WE MEAN BY CULTURE\\nForms of Cultural Expression\\nWhen we hear or see a cultural programme either on radio or TV or on stage, this\\nusually includes music, songs and dance. Each of these is a form of cultural expres-\\nsion. Each such form communicates a message. A sculpture of the Buddha in\\nmeditation for instance, may be meant to encourage feelings of peace and tranquility\\n(Fig.29.1). \\nA folk/story may teach and entertain, whereas a towering monument like\\nthe Qutab Minar may tell us with awe (Fig.29.2). In other words, culture can be used\\nto transmit a variety of ideas. We will see more examples of this in Lesson No.31.\\n49\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nWe have a wide range of cultural forms in India. These include sculpture, archi-\\ntecture literature, painting and music to name a few. There is an immense variety\\nwithin each of these. For example, if we think of songs, we can immediately think\\nof so many types: folk songs, film songs, bhajans, qawwalis. etc. Each type is\\nusually sung on a special occasion, and has a special purpose. At the same time,\\nyou may have noticed that some film songs are in fact bhajans or set to folk tunes.\\nIn what ways do you think that a bhajan in a film is different from that sung by\\ndevotees in a temple?\\n29.2 POPULAR OR FOLK CULTURE\\nCommon people have developed rich cultural traditions which are often called popu-\\nlar, literally of the people. People have expressed themselves and communicated\\ncultural values through song, dance and storytelling. \\nAll of these go into the making of\\nfolk culture.\\nGiven their limited material resources, common people cannot build grand\\nmonuments, but they create and use countless smaller objects which are extremely\\nbeautiful. While some of these objects are used for routine activities, other are\\nFig 29.3 Kailashnath Temple\\nFig 29.1 Buddha\\nFig 29.2 Qutab Minar\\n50\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nreserved for special occasions. Unfortunately, most of the material used is perish-\\nable, such as cane, cloth, wood, leaves or earthenware. As such, these objects do\\nnot last very long. So we know much less about the cultures of common people\\nfrom ancient times (Fig 29.3).\\n29.3 CLASSICAL CULTURE\\nDance forms such as Bharat Natyam are often referred to as classical. This means that\\nit is one of the finest forms of artistic expression. Similarly Kalidasa is regarded as an\\nexample of a classical Sanskrit poet, The temples built by the Cholas are regarded as\\nexamples of classical temple architecture, as is the Taj Mahal of Mughal architecture\\n(Fig.29.4)\\nWe can justly be proud of these achievements. However, we need to remember that\\nat the time when Kalidasa wrote (c 4th century AD) most people in north and central\\nIndia spoke various forms of Prakrit (from which many modern Indian languages have\\ndeveloped). While they would have followed the Prakrit portions of Kalidasas plays,\\nthey would not have been able to understand his Sanskrit Verses. Similarly, common\\npeople would have found it difficult to enter the exquisite monuments we have just\\nmentioned. Entry may have been restricted on grounds of caste or religion.\\nAs such, classical culture tends to be highly developed but exclusive. It is only since\\nthe last two centuries or so that many Sanskrit works have been translated into\\nregional languages, and monuments have been thrown open to a wider public.\\nFolk and classical cultures have co-existed and interacted for centuries. They have\\nborrowed and adapted ideas from each other.\\nHow Anthropologists Define Culture\\nAnthropology literally means the study of human beings. Cultural and social\\nanthropologists study present-day societies, including rituals, beliefs, social customs,\\nwork patterns etc. So, When anthropologists write about culture they include some\\nor all of these aspects.\\nFig 29.4 Taj Mahal\\n51\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nThe Archaeologist And Culture\\nWhen often feel that we have something in common with those who eat and\\ndress like us, whereas we tend to treat those who eat and dress differently as\\nbelonging to a different culture. This definition of culture is very similar to that\\nused by the archaeologist. An archaeologist studies houses, tools, pots,\\nstatues, etc and tries to reconstruct how people lived in the past. Because all\\nthese objects can be seen and touched, and are more or less permanent they\\nare regarded as part of our material culture. You will learn more about the\\nproduction of some aspects of our material culture in next lesson (30).\\nWhile clothes and food are also part of our material culture, they decay very\\nfast. As such, while archaeologists do often recover traces of food and clothes\\nused in earlier times, these are generally fewer than those of things such as\\nutensils, tools or weapons.\\nWe can see then that culture can be defined in many ways:\\n(a) as forms of cultural expression (e.g. song, dance, music, painting, sculp-\\nture, architecture, etc.)\\n(b) in terms of the social group which produces or uses a cultural form (e.g.\\npopular/folk, classical/elite)\\n(c) broader definitions in terms of aspects of social, religious and material\\nlife.\\nHave you noticed how these definitions overlap? Look at the picture of this\\nhouse (Fig.29.5). In terms of its form we would classify it as an example of\\narchitecture (as opposed to sculpture or music). It is also, at the same time, an\\nexample of folk or popular culture, as it is a part of the material culture of those\\nwho build and live in it.\\nFig 29.5 A House\\n52\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nAnother example: a painting from Ajanta can be classified as a classical religious\\npainting.

One of\\nthe earliest and best-known Kashmiri poets was Lai Ded, a woman saint of the\\nfourteenth century.\\nToday, medieval saint-composers such as Mira Bai, Guru Nanak and Kabir are\\nrevered not only in their own regions but throughout India. Many saints belonged to\\nlow castes and used the language of common people. Their compositions, part of\\nour popular culture, have been transmitted orally for centuries.\\nOur religious beliefs also influences our daily lives. Sometimes, marriage rituals, the\\nfood we eat, and the clothese we wear are governed by religious rules. But, more\\noften, what we eat and wear, or our marriage customs, “vary according to regions\\nrather than according to religion. To take a simple example. Hindu Muslim Christian\\nand Sikh wornd in Punjab–generally wear salwar kameej, whereas Hindu, Mus-\\nlim and Christian women in Tamil Nadu usually wear saris. So while our religious\\nbeliefs do shape our cultural practices, they are not the only influence.\\nFig 29.7 Dilwara Temple\\n54\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\n29.5 OUR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION\\nMany of our cultural practices are influenced by our social and economic situation.\\nFor example, our social situation may influence what we wear. You may have\\nnoticed that many women are required to dress differently, depending on whether\\nthey are unmarried, or widowed.\\nSometimes, our cultural practices may be influenced by both our social and our\\neconomic situation. This includes such things as our tastes and preferences in\\nmusic-whether we like folk songs, film songs, classical music or western pop\\nmusic. While we can learn Hindi film songs quickly from the radio, for example,\\nlearning classical music is far more difficult and expensive. It also takes much\\nlonger, and many of us might find it difficult to spare time for it.\\nThe cultural objects we produce and use are also often limited by our economic re-\\nsources. None of us would have been able to build the Taj Mahal even if we had wanted\\nto. This was only possible for Shah Jahan, the ruler of a large and prosperous empire.\\nFig 29.8 Jama Masjid\\nShah Jahan began the construction of the Taj Mahal in 1632, in memory of his\\nwife, Mumtaz Mahal. It took about twenty two years to build the monument, with\\nas many as twenty thousand labourers working daily during the earlier/stages. The\\ncost of construction was forty million rupees, an enormous sum in those days.\\n55\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nFig 29.10 Jaipur Fort\\nFig 29.9 Jodhpur Fort\\n56\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nIn fact, most of the splendid forts, palaces, and religious monuments we see (illus-\\ntration, Jodhpur/Jaipur) were built by rulers.

This happens when\\npeople with different cultural traditions come into contact with one another. Such\\ncontact can take place through the expeditions and voyages of merchants or\\ntraders, or when conquerors invade a country. It also occurs when pilgrims or trav-\\nellers visit distant lands, and when craftsmen and labouring women and men travel\\nfrom place to place in search of employment.\\nThose involved in such interactions learn about the practice of different peoples,\\nand carry their own ideas and customs to new lands. In the process, the cultural\\npractices of all those who participate in such interaction tends to change.\\nLet us take the example of food. Did you know that vegetables like the potato and\\ntomato were introduced to India about five hundred years ago by Portuguese trad-\\ners and soliders who brought them from central America, and that tea has come\\nfrom China? Other food items, such as rice and the dals we use, oilseeds like mus-\\ntard and sesame, have been cultivated in India for over five thousand years.\\nIf you look at what we eat today, you will notice that it is a mixture of foods which\\nhave been traditionally available, as well as more recent additions. At the same time,\\npeople in other parts of the world, such as the USA and Great Britain, have devel-\\noped taste for Indian cuisine, especially curries and kababs. You will come across\\nmore examples of cultural interaction and its effects in the lessons which follow.\\n57\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.3\\nState whether true or false:\\n1.\\nCultural interaction can take place when merchants visit new lands.\\n2.\\nInvasions do not lead to cultural interaction.\\n3.\\nTea was grown in central America.\\n4.\\nMustard and sesame were brought to India by the Portuguese.\\n5.\\nCurries are popular in Great Britain.\\n 29.7 GLOBALISATION\\nThe process whereby the entire world is being brought under a single economic and\\ncultural network is often referred to as globalisation, (from the word globe)\\n29.8 WHAT IS A GLOBAL VILLAGE\\nYou may have heard the expression global village. At first sight it may appear to\\nbe contradictory. How can something which is global or worldwide be a village at\\nthe same time?\\nThe phrase global village was used for the first time by a scholar named Mc–Luhan.\\nHe felt that with the increased use of television, communication would change\\nFig 29.11 Airline network\\nINDIA\\nAIRPORTS AND AIR ROUTES\\nINDIAN\\n         OCEAN\\n58\\nHISTORY\\n        MODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\ndramatically This meant that people would be able to send messages across\\nthousands of miles almost instantly. As a result, physical distance would no longer\\nappear as a barrier, preventing or slowing down communication.\\nOver the last few decades, and especially in the last ten years, the vast TV networks\\nwhich have emerged through the use of satellites and other powerful technological\\ndevices might make us  believe that Mc-Luhan’s prediction has come true. Sitting in\\nIndia, we can watch Nelson Mandela taking over as president of South Africa, or a\\ncricket match in Sharjah. But then we may ask are the differences amongst people\\nonly those of physical distance?\\nWhile most people who live together in a village are farmers, there are obvious\\ndifferences amongst rich landlords, small farmers, tenant cultivatiors, craftsmen, and\\nlandless agricultural labourers. In other words, people can be close to one another\\nin physical terms, but be separated by social and economic distance. As the land-\\nlord are more powerful they tend to dominate social, economic and cultural interac-\\ntion in the village. So although communication may be direct, and face-to-face, it is\\nat the same time influenced by the fact that those who participate in it are not equal\\nin status.\\nThis problem is aggravated even more in the global village. Here communication is\\ndominated by people in cities. You may have noticed that on the average, city-\\ndwellers are richer and more influential than those who live in villages. We can go a\\nstep further and distinguish between cities in developing countries like India, and\\nthose in developed countries like the USA. People living in the latter are generally\\nricher than those living in Indian cities, and it is usually powerful people in these\\ncities of the developed countries who produce and beam out TV programmes,\\nwhich we then receive.\\nWhat happens in the global village is that although distances are overcome, commu-\\nnication becomes a one-day process. We can see and hear what is presented by\\nthe TV producers, but there is no genuine dialogue. So unlike face-to-face conver-\\nsation in a small village, where we can discuss, interrupt, quarrel and make up, we\\nsimply receive the messages which flow to us from TV and often follow them. It is\\nmuch more difficult to question or challenge what we are told.\\n29.9 ADVERTISING AND CONSUMERISM\\nConsider the programmes we listen to on radio, or watch on TV-news, films, talk\\nshows. programmes on science, music, history, sports-the variety seems infinite.\\nHowever, no matter what we might choose to watch, we also see dozens if not\\nhundreds of advertisements. Why is this so? This is because advertisers or spon-\\nsors pay for the programmes we see. They are usually carefully to choose\\nprogrammes which are popular, so that they can reach out to a wide audience. They\\ncan then advertise their products to millions of people.\\nWhat the advertisers hope is that while watching our favourite TV shows we will\\nnotice their products and be tempted to try out. In other words, they get an\\n59\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL SITUATION\\nopportunity to persuade us to buy their brands or products, no matter what soaps,\\ncreams, cars, household appliances the list is endless. This tendency to buy things\\nbeyond our immediate and basic requirements and occasionally beyond our means is\\nknown as consumerism.\\nThus, while distances have indeed been bridged dramatically, the new technology is\\nused to the advantage of big manufacturers including multinational companies. They\\ncreate a large population of consumers who are persuaded to spend what they\\nearn, or even borrow to buy various “objects of desire”.\\nAs it works at present, globalisation usually serves the interests of rich industrialists\\nmore than anything else. For globalisation to be truly beneficial it will have to de-\\nvelop into an interaction based on respect for cultural diversity and a sharing of the\\nworld’s resources rather than their concentration in the hands of a few.\\nWe also need to remember that the potential benefits of globalisation cannot be\\nignored. Even as we are persuaded to buy foreign products through TV programmes,\\nwe also learn about other cultures. We have to decide what is worth accepting and\\nwhat can be rejected. Globalisation is something we now live with. We must under-\\nstand that we can do so on our own terms.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.4\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1.\\nGlobalisation is taking place in the spheres of the \\n and cultural\\ncommunication.\\n2.\\nThe \\n  phrase was coined by McLuhan.\\n3.\\nAdvertisers \\n TV programmers.\\n4.\\nGlobal communications are dominated by the \\n countries.\\nWHAT YOU HA\\nVE LEARNT\\nCulture is an integral part of human existence. There are many forms of cultural\\nexpression. Forms which are produced by or for common people are known as\\npopular, whereas more exclusive forms are known as classical culture includes our\\nsocial customs as well as objects such as clothes or food which we use in our daily\\nlives. Our cultural practices are often influenced by our religious beliefs and our\\nsocial and economic condition. They are also shaped through interaction amongst\\npeople. In the present-day situation, globalisation represents one specific form of\\ninteraction. This is a mixed blessing. It often leads to consumerism. This is encour-\\naged by manufactures who advertise their products. At the same time, globalization\\nis a beneficial force as it helps us communicate across great distances.

In this lesson we will look at how some of these are produced, who\\nproduced them and who uses them.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter Studing this lesson, you will be able to;\\n•\\nwhat techniques were used in the production of paintings and for whom were\\nthese paintings produced;\\n•\\nthe different kinds of textiles and costumes produced in India;\\n•\\nthe rich and varied literature of India which ranges from epics to folk songs and\\n•\\nthe nature of food production and the wide variety of foods in the various parts of\\nIndia.\\n30.1 PAINTINGS, PAINTERS & PATRONS\\nIn this section we shall try to understand about our artists and their paintings-what did\\nthey paint what did they paint with and for whom did they paint?\\nIn the past arts and crafts were a part of everyday life and what was useful was also\\nbeautiful. The pots and pans our ancestors used, the clothes they wore and the homes they\\nlived in had different kinds of designs on them. (Fig 30.1)\\nFig 30.1 Harappan Painted Pottery\\n63\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL PRODUCTION\\nThe most exquisite designs were produced by women on the threshold of their homes\\nwith rice flour, turmeric (haldi) and vermilion (kumkum) powders. The Madhubani\\npaintings originated in one such rural tradition in Bihar where scenes from the life of\\nKrishna were reproduced on the walls, on paper or any other medium during the\\nJanmashtami (Lord Krishna’s birthday) festival as well as other festive occasions\\nthese instances art had a ritual purpose and was considered auspicious.\\nThe earliest paintings which have come down to us are the cave paintings created by\\nhunting and gathering tribes. Some of the best known of these are to be found in the\\ncaves and rock shelters of Mirzapur and Banda in Uttar Pradesh, Bhimbetka near\\nBhopal and Singanpur near Raigarh, in Madhya Pradesh, the Mahadav hills of the\\nVindhya ranges and Bellary in Karnataka. These paintings are usually hunting scenes\\nwhich give us an idea of the vegetation and animal life of the area and the nature of\\ntools used by early men and women. These were simple tools like the bow and arrow\\nor axes. We do not know exactly why these paintings were made but it is possible that\\nthey had some magical significance and were meant to ensure success in the hunt.\\nWhile early men and women made these paintings for their own needs, in later times\\npaintings were usually produced under royal patronage which means that kings paid\\nand sometimes maintained the painter in order to get them made.\\nThe earliest of these are found at the famous caves of Bagh (in Madhya Pradesh)\\nand of Ellora and Ajanta (in Maharashtra). The themes in Ajanta are drawn from the\\nlife of the Buddha, especially depictions from the Jataka stories which record the\\nmany lives of the Buddha. You will be learning more about Buddhism in the lesson\\nNo.31. There are also some scenes from every day life such as the famous depiction\\nfrom the Ajanta caves of the princess engaged in her makeup. The arts of Ajanta and\\nEllora were patronized by the Gupta and Vakataka rulers and who belonged roughly\\nto the period from the fourth to sixth centuries. These paintings are remarkable for\\ntheir unfading colours. It is believed that the Mahabalipuram cave art of the time of\\nthe Pallava kings who ruled between the sixth and tenth centuries, were inspired by\\nthe artistic techniques employed in the Ajanta and Ellora paintings.\\nThe rock cut temples of Mahabalipuram (located just outside Chennai) belong\\nto the period of Mamallan Narasimha Pallavan who ruled in the seventh cen-\\ntury. Here beautiful paintings and sculputres depicting scenes from the\\nMahabharata, are found in the interior of caves and on rock surfaces.\\nThe origin of paintings as art objects was a development that happened in royal courts\\nand in towns and cities. Among such traditions we can count the Mughal miniatures.\\nThe Mughal paintings (produced between the 16th and 18th centuries) were often\\ntimes a pleasing blend of Safawid and Hindostani traditions. The Mughal and Rajput\\npainters despite their distinctive styles also inspired each other. Book binding and manu-\\nscript illustrations were two associated art which sprang up around the same time. The\\nlavishly illustrated Padshahnama is a good example of the skill Persian craftsmen\\npossessed in the art of manuscript illustration. Other famous illustrated manuscripts\\ninclude the Akbarnama. Both are biographies of kings celebrating their achievements.\\nAnother example is the illustrated Jain manuscripts. These manuscripts begin to\\nappear from the sixth century A.D. onwards. The Jains decided to preserve their\\n64\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL PRODUCTION\\nancient knowledge by writing it down. In some cases merchants paid artists to pre-\\npare the manuscripts. These manuscripts were beautifully illustrated through minia-\\ntures. It is believed that the first Tirthankara Rishabhadeva was himself a skilled\\npainter. Among the early illustrated Jain manuscripts is: Ashtasahasrika Prajnana\\nParamita. The best known miniature paintings on Jain religion and philosophy is the\\nTrilokya Dipika.\\nThe early paintings were leisurely works of art while some modern artistic works are\\ndone at a fast pace to meet immediate requirements. For example hoardings and\\nposters advertising films are meant to catch the attention of the public and are changed\\nevery week. Unlike early paintings these hoardings have a short life since they are\\nfrequently replaced.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 30.2\\n1.\\nState whether true or false:\\n(a) Madhubani paintings originated as ritual and religious traditions.\\n(b) Cave paintings enjoyed royal patronage.\\n(c) Mughal miniatures constitute a rural tradition.\\n(d) Akbarnama and Padshahnama are biographies of kings.\\n2.\\nName some of the places where early cave paintings are to be found.\\n 30.2 INDIAN TEXTILES AND COSTUMES\\nGeographical and climatic factors have greatly influenced the clothing of the Indian people.\\nWhile in northern India people use both woolen and cotton clothes, in southern India which\\nhas a warm climate people wear only cotton. The clothing of men in the warm regions\\nconsists of an upper cloth and a lower cloth of roughly one and a half yards. In northern\\nIndia men also wear a stitched shirt called kurta and trousers known as pyjama. The\\nwomen may “either wear a six yard unstitched cloth called sari or may wear stitched\\ngarments similar to what the men wear called kurta and salwar. The wearing of the sari\\ndepends on the cultural, traditions of different regions. For example the Maharashtrian and\\nTamilian women wear a nine yard sari with a separator between the legs while the women\\nof Kerala wear a four or five yard sari just up to the ankles.\\nIt is believed that costumes in early India consisted of unstitched cloth. It is diffi-\\ncult to tell when Indians first began to wear stitched clothes but some of the\\npaintings and sculptures dating back to the early Christian era show Kushana\\nguards and soldiers wearing trousers and jackets. This may have been the result\\nof Greek influence. In ancient sculptures such as the ones at Amaravati (in Andhra\\nPradesh) or Brahadisvaram (in Tamil Nadu), it is only the serving classes and\\ndancing girls who are depicted in stitched garments and not the kings or the gods.\\n65\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL PRODUCTION\\nNational Museum depiction of the headless sculpture of Kanishka wearing a coat,\\nfrom Mathura Museum.\\nThe production of cotton in India goes back to pre-historic times. We have definite\\nevidence for the use of cotton from Mohenjodaro one of the largest cities of the\\nHarappa civilization. Spindals have been found by archaeologists. The earliest literary\\nreference to the loom on “which cloth is woven, comes from the Atharva Veda.\\nSpinning was the work of women especially widows and unmarried women.\\nIndian textiles reflect culture. Everything is important- the colours chosen, the designs\\nand the occasion it is worn. Red represents fertility and is generally worn by the bride\\non the occasion of her wedding. Ochre and white represent purity and sacrifice and\\nare usually worn by spiritual persons and also by widows. Black is considered inaus-\\npicious although in south India pregnant women wear black perhaps to ward off the\\nevil eye. Colouring was traditionally done with vegetable dyes such as indigo and\\nmadder although now most dyers have switched over to cheaper chemical dyes.\\nThe earliest designs on textiles were geometrical. The depiction of certain types of\\nplants and animals on textiles from different regions gives us an idea of what those\\npeople were familiar with and also regarded as auspicious. The lotus or the kalka\\n(mango) designs are popular in most parts of India. India produces a rich variety of\\ntextiles. The brocaded silks of Varanasi called Jamdani and Jamewar, the gold bor-\\ndered silks of Kanchipuram and the tassore of Assam, Birigal and Karnataka consti-\\ntute well known varieties of silk- Cotton textiles can be woven on simple horizontal\\nlooms while brocaded silks required more complex looms with multiple pedals. Silks\\nare more expensive than cottons and can be afforded only by a few.\\nDifferent types of textiles require different production techniques. The textile called\\ntie and dye’ and known within different cultural traditions as bandhini (Rajasthan and\\nGujarat), ikat (Orissa) or chungdi (Tamil Nadu) is produced by a process in which the\\ncloth and sometimes the yarn is tied and dyed.\\nThe kalamkari textiles constitute a living tradition in Andhra. Literally the term\\n‘kalamkari’ means wording (lean) with the pen kalam). The painters were patronized\\nby the Deccani Sultanates (from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries) and the\\nnobility. The themes depicted constitute a blend of Islamic and Hindu motifs. Interest-\\ningly, what is sold today as ‘kalamkari’ are machine made, block-printed textiles! In\\nfact much of the cloth that is produced these days is done on the power loom.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 30.1\\n1.\\nWhat do you understand by the bandhini technique and where are bandhinis\\nproduced?\\n2.\\nExplain the meaning of the term kalamkari?\\n3.\\nState whether true or false:\\n(a) Cotton clothes are worn in warm weather.\\n66\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL PRODUCTION\\n(b) Silks are cheaper than cotton.\\n(c) Textiles which are tied dyed are known as jamdani.\\n(d) Indigo and madder are vegetable dyes.\\n30.3 LITERATURE\\nWe shall now look at our rich and varied literatures which range from epics to folk\\nsongs, from classical to popular texts.\\nIndia is a land where many languages are spoken. There are as many as 325 lan-\\nguages dialects spoken in India, for eg. While Hindi is the main language in Uttar\\nPradesh, the people of this state speak in as many as eighty five dialects which are\\nregional variations of Hindi.\\nOur literature is both religious as well as nonreligious in content, dealing with themes\\nfrom the life of the people or the court. The Vedas written in Sanskrit form a part of\\nour religious literature while texts like the Mrichakatika literally The Story of the Toy\\nCan’ of Shudraka deal with worldly themes.\\nA rich range of regional variations exists especially in the re-telling of our major epics\\n- the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. It is well known that while Valmiki wrote the\\nRamayana known as the ‘Adi Kavya’ in Sanskrit, Tulsidas wrote the Hindi version\\nwhich is popularly known as Ramcharitamanas. The court poet of the Cholas called\\nKamban wrote the Ramayana in Tamil while the popular folk version of the Ramayana\\nin Telugu was written by a peasant woman called Molla.\\nIt is interesting that even the style of writing the text is influenced by the social situa-\\ntion of the writer. For example while Kamban uses the language and imagery of the\\nelite ruling class Molla writes like a peasant woman and in describing the sunset she\\nsays that the sun went down the sky like a worker tired after the day’s labours.\\nWe shall now briefly look at some of the regional and folk variations of the Mahabharata\\nwhich is believed to have been authored by the sage Veda Vyasa in Sanskrit. In a\\nTelugu version of the Mahabharata it is said that after the Pandavas led by Yudhishthira\\nlost their Property and freedom in the game of dice to Duryodhana Draupadi\\nexercised her right to participate in the dice game. To show her contempt for her\\nopponent she threw the dice with her foot and began to win back whatever her\\nhusbands had lost. Daupadi is worshipped as a deity in many parts of south India.\\nA Tamil version of the Mahabharata refers to a Pandyan queen called Alirani who\\nhated man and ruled only with the aid of women. It is said that she conquered Arjuna\\nin battle, and later married him. Bhima is the central figure in the Mahabharata stories\\nfrom the Himalayan region. He and his tribal wife Hidimaba are primary deities in the\\nregion of Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. The practice of polyandry still exists following\\nthe Mahabharata tradition in which Draupadi is married to the five Pandava brothers.\\nIn the Chattisgarh version of the Mahabharata called Pandavani’, Bhima is again the\\ncentral character. Many tribal communities of the north-east claim to be directly de-\\nscended from Bhima and Hidimba. For example the Darrang Kachari of Dimapur\\ndescribe themselves as Bhim-ni-fa’, i.e. the children of Bhima1.\\nAlthough many events and characters are identifiable with northern India, the\\nMahabharata has a rich tradition which spreads across the length and breadth of the\\n67\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL PRODUCTION\\ncountry. Different communities understand and transmit it in their own ways incorpo-\\nrating various local stories this way, the Mahabharata reflects the different cultures of\\nthe people. These range from classical narrations to folk ballads.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 30.2\\n1.\\nWhat kind of literature do the Vedas represent?\\n2.\\nIn which regions of India can you expect to find Bhima and Hidimba being wor-\\nshipped?\\n3.\\nWho wrote the Hindi version of the Ramayana and what is it known as?\\n30.4 THE CULTURE OF FOOD\\nLet us now take a look at our food habits.. We shall see how widely they differ from\\nregion to region and the ways in which, over a period of time, our food habits have\\nchanged due to interaction.\\nThe food habits of Indians varies depending on the nature of crops grown in differ-\\nent regions, the cultural practices of different communities and the economic and\\nsocial status of the consuming class/community or individuals. While wheat is the\\nstaple diet of the Indo-Gangetic belt, consumed mainly in the form of rice is the\\nstaple food of south Indians because very little wheat is grown in the regions south\\nof the Vindhya mountains.\\nWe know something of the food eaten by our ancestors through the archaeological\\nevidence of food grains. Habitation sites, where people had actually lived, have pro-\\nduced evidence of wheat (for example the new Stone Age site of Mehrgarh in\\nBaluchistan) or the evidence of rice, ragi and horsegram especially in the southern\\nsites like Brahmagiri and Hallur in Karnatakas, Piklihal in Andhra Pradesh and\\nPaiyampalli in Tamil Nadu. Evidence from Piklihal suggests that the people here were\\nherders who domesticated cattle, sheep and goats.\\nPots were used for storing water and grain as well as for cooking. Indian archaeolo-\\ngists have classified ancient cultures on the basis of the pottery they produced such as\\nthe Painted Grey Ware, Black Polished pottery etc. Bronze age archaeological sites\\nlike Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu have also produced bronze and gold vessels. These,\\nmore obviously used by the rich.\\nMost regions have their own distinctive cuisine. The southern states like Andhra\\nPradesh. Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are rice-based cultures. Idli, Dosa and\\nUpma prepared by south Indians have now gained popularity in northern India and the\\neasy availability of the these dishes in north Indian states is a proof of the interaction\\nbetween different communities. Kerala like West Bengal which also has a coastal\\nculture, is known for its fish preparations.\\n68\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL PRODUCTION\\nWith the coming of the Mughals, ‘Mughlai’ dishes like the tandoori chicken and seekh\\nkababs along with fruits like the water melon, became a part of Indian cuisine. Awadhi\\n(Awadh refers to the region of eastern UP) cuisine today is reflective of Mughal\\nNawabi culture. In the sixteenth century the Europeans, especially the Portuguese\\nintroduced potatoes, tomatoes and green chillies into Indian food which is now an\\nindispensable part of our cooking. French beans also became a part of Indian cuisine\\nduring this period. Thus, cultural interaction has led to changes in our food habits.\\nAn ordinary meal in a family may consist of rice or roti, dal i.e. lentils and a vegetable\\npreparation. While the daily meals are usually prepared by women at home cooking\\non a large scale is generally done by men. There are many poor people in India who\\ncan only afford to eat gruel. The rich may eat a variety of foods consisting of both\\nvegetarian and meat dishes, meat being much more expensive than vegetables. On\\nspecial occasions like marriages all communities prepare a feast of a number of dishes\\nhaving the distinct flavour of their region.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 30.3\\n1.\\nWhat are the staple crops of India and how do they shape on food habits?\\n2.\\nName some popular dishes of south India.\\n3.\\nMatch the Following:\\nRoti\\nKerala\\nUpma\\nPortuguese\\nSeekh kabab\\nTamil Nadu\\nChillies\\nN.

We have seen\\nthat our early ancestors produced objects such as pottery which were useful as well\\nas beautiful. However in later times art objects like paintings began to be produced\\nunder royal patronage.\\nWe also noticed that people wore clothing according to climatic requirements and that\\ncostumes varied from region to region. We have learnt about textile varieties, designs\\nand some special types like the kalamkari and the chungdi.

Many of\\nthese stories are drawn from epics and religious texts like the Ramayana or the Bible,\\nor from collections of stories like the Panchatantra or the Arabian Nights. Through\\nthese stories, all of us have absorbed many aspects of our cultural heritage. Culture is\\ncommunicated through various means- oral, written through music, and nowadays,\\nvia film and television too.\\nOBJECTIVES\\n•\\nafter studying this lesson you will be able to;\\n•\\nexplain how speech writing & printing help cultural communication;\\n•\\nlist some methods of cultural communication;\\n•\\ndescribe how music is used to communicate different ideas and\\n•\\nexplain how a variety of cultural forms were used to spread Buddhism.\\n31.1 HOW CULTURE IS COMMUNICATED\\nCan you imagine a world without language? Language is a basic characteristic of\\nhuman society. It is not only a means for people to understand each other, but is also\\na vehicle for the transmission of cultural ideas. A shared language knits people to-\\ngether, but also distinguishes them from one another. For the people of Punjab are\\nbound together by their common language, Punjabi, but are also differentiated from\\nthose whose mother tongue is not Punjabi. Did you know that Punjabi is one of the\\ntwo most widely spoken languages in Pakistan also?\\nAnother language in the subcontinent which is shared by people of different\\ncountries is Bengali.\\nThe spread of language and culture is influenced by geographical factors. People\\nliving in near by areas usually speak the same or similar languages. Those who\\nlive thousands of miles apart have very different mother tongues. This is because\\n72\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL COMMUNICATION\\ncommunication between far flung areas was difficult before modern means of\\ntransport developed. Cultures tended to evolve in relative isolation and ended up\\nbeing very distinct.\\nCommunication is still difficult in densely forested and mountainous areas. A tribe\\nliving on one face of a hill or a valley may not even know of another tribe living on\\nanother hillside just a few kilometers away. The language they speak can therefore\\nby very different.\\nHowever, in areas like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where vast plains are well connected\\nby rivers, people could travel easily even in ancient times. So similar languages and\\ncustoms developed due to regular interaction.\\nEven where one language such as Hindi or Tamil is spoken over a large area, there\\nare veriations from district to district. No version is sufficiently different to be called\\na language, so they are called dialects of a language.\\nSpoken language was and remain one of the most important means of communica-\\ntion. However the invention of writing widened the scope of communication.\\nMessages could henceforth be sent over long distances and preserved over time.\\nWriting was known in India over 4000 years ago. This was the Harappan script which\\nhas not been deciphered yet. With the decline of the Harappan civilization around\\n1800 BC, writing was also lost. The knowledge of writing reappeared around the 3rd\\ncentury BC. This writing called Brahmi is the mother of all modern Indian scripts.\\nInitially, rulers and wealthy people had important documents engraved on rock\\nsurfaces, stone tablets and copper plates. Cloth leather, the bark of the tree called\\nbhojapatra and palm leaf called talapatra were used for writing on.\\nWhat kind of books do you think there were in earlier times? There were religious\\ntexts which were used by priests. Law books, called Shastras were written for the\\nuse of kings and their ministers. Drama and poetry were composed for the enjoyment\\nof the wealthy. It in clear that most books were therefore meant only for a small\\nnumber of privileged people.\\nHowever, there were also epics like the Mahabharata (about which you read in\\nlesson 30), popular stories collected in the Jataka tales, Hitopadesa etc, and numerons\\nmythological legends in the Puranas Stories from these were transmitted orally by\\nprofessional story tellers, bards and even local temple priests. In the course of telling\\nstories, many variations occurred over time. So we have today, numerous different\\nversions of popular legends. Books thus touched the lives of many people even though\\nvery few could read or write.\\nEach book had to be copied out by hand. Such handwritten copies are called\\nmanuscripts. Manuscript production became, a specialized art in medieval times.\\nScribes used beautiful handwriting called calligraphy. The pages were often\\ndecorated with beautiful illustrations. Copying manuscripts was obviously a laborious\\nprocess, so very few copies were made.\\nPrinting was introduced in the mid 16th century. Books could now be produced in far\\ngreater numbers in lesser time and lower cost. However since few people were\\nliterate, the immediate effect was limited. A more dramatic transformation took place\\nin the 19th Century when full use of the press and printing technology was made by\\nnationalists and social reformers.\\n73\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL COMMUNICATION\\nThe first newspaper in India was published in 1760 in English by an officer of the\\nEast India Co. This was followed by many others. These newspapers focused on\\nproviding information about Europe to Englishmen in India.\\nFrom the early 19th century, many newspapers began to appear in the vernacular\\nlanguages. They were published by nationalists who had the interests of Indians in\\nmind. News and views were carried across not only to the educated few, but through\\nthem to many others as well. Many thinkers saw that British domination of India\\ncould be overcome only if the traditional ills of Indian society were first removed.\\nThese reformers not only campaigned directly, but also used the press to build public\\nopinion. One such reformer was Raja Rammohan Roy of Bengal.\\nIn 1821, Rammohan began to publish the newspaper Samachar Kaumudi’ in Bengali,\\nfollowed by the Mierat-ul-akhbar’ in Persian in 1822 and the ‘Brahmanical Maga-\\nzine’ in English. Through these papers, he advocated education of women and widow\\nremarriage and attacked sati and the ills of the caste system. He also published nu-\\nmerous pamphlets underlining his vision of an ideal society based on the best teach-\\nings from major religions of the world. He founded a community called the Brahmo\\nSamaj which was joined by numerous educated and progressive men in Bengal. It\\nwas owing to the printing press that Rammohan’s ideas could reach such a wide\\naudience. You can estimate the power of the press when you consider that a rival\\nnewspaper, ‘Chanridka’ was published in 1822 to oppose his ideas of social reform.\\nWe see thus that newspapers and magazines do not merely give information about\\nevents and occurrences around the world, but also mould our ways of thinking. Ideas\\nand views have of course been exchanged from time immemorial. What however is\\nspecific to modern forms of communication is that the transmission of ideas becomes\\na one-way process. While the owner of a newspaper can influence the views of its\\nreaders, the reader cannot exert a similar influence. Can you see the similarity with\\nglobalization about which you read in lesson 29.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 31.1\\n1.\\nFrom which script are most modern Indian scripts derived?\\n2.\\nName two kinds of books written in earlier times.\\n3.\\nWhy was manuscript production expensive?\\n4.\\nState whether true of false:\\n(i) Language is not a means of communication.\\n(ii) Hitopadesa is a collection of stories.\\n(iii) Rammohan was the only reformer to use the press in the 19th century.\\n(iv)Writing made long-distance communication possible.\\n74\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL COMMUNICATION\\n31.2 MUSIC AS A VEHICLE OF CULTURE\\nAmong the earliest expression of culture are music and dance. Early people clapped\\nhands, or beat the earth  with sticks for rhythm to accompany songs and dances.\\nGradually many kinds of drums and instruments came to be used. Garba Gujarat,\\nKathakali from Kerala and Gidda, Bhangra from Punjab are examples of folk dance.\\nThese were and are still performed to celebrate festive occasions, to mark important\\nceremonies, to express various sentiments, and sometimes even to serve as a channel\\nof protest.\\nFolk songs celebrate spring, the coming of rains, or the ripening of corn which are all\\ncentral to the agricultural cycle. There are also songs of masons and potters. You may\\nhave heard construction workers singing while heaving heavy loads as a team listen\\nto them carefully the words are about their work.\\nThere are also numerous songs by and about women-expressing the sorrow of a\\nlover whose beloved has gone away, of a girl leaving her parental home upon her\\nmarriage, even about the conflict between mother and daughter-in-law.\\nFolk music is by its very nature participatory. It evolves along with the people’s experi-\\nences. Folk art can therefore be said to be ‘consumed’ by the same people who create it.\\nFolk culture is not meant for an audience. However, in modern times, the original\\npurpose of this culture is transformed. Thus you may sometimes see folk dances\\nperformed on stage while an audience watches!\\nYou read about classical culture in lesson 29. Classical music is a highly developed\\nform of music since it is based on precise rules, it can be called the grammar of music\\nsinging or playing it (on an instrument) requires a long period of intensive training.\\nHowever, anyone can derive great joy from listening to it. In fact, numerous melodies\\nof film and folk songs are based on classical ragas/or simplified forms of classical\\nragas. Both classical and folk music have interacted closely and enriched each other\\nfor centuries, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to draw a sharp dividing line.\\nClassical music was earlier patronised by kings. The legendary Tansen was one of\\nthe nine jewels in the court of the Mughal emperor, Akbar.\\nNowadays business houses, and national and international cultural organizations\\npatronize classical music.\\nRelated to both these kinds of music is that used for religious purposes. In fact many\\nfolk and classical songs have religious themes.\\nThe earliest example of religious music in India come from the Samaveda. This 3000\\nyear old  text comprises Vedic chants set to melody for recitation during the perfor-\\nmance of sacrifices.\\nFrom medieval times, the compositions of Bhakti and Sufi saints were sung by their\\nfollowers and by lay worshippers. These songs are familiar to us today as bhajans and\\nqawwalis. The lyrics express devotion and love for a personal god sometimes they\\nrequest divine help to tide over worldly troubles. Qawwalis and bhajans often have a\\nclassical foundation and a popular or folk form.\\n75\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL COMMUNICATION\\nA comparatively new form of music is film music. Initially film music relies very\\nheavily on classical and folk music. Many of the old, popular film songs are based on\\nmelodies form both Indian and western classical music. But film music also evolved\\ncertain now features. It brought into use the orchestra which originally belong to\\nwestern classical music in addition to Indian instruments. Nowadays of course, new\\nkinds of fusion music are evolved everyday.\\nBhajans are sometimes related to the experiences of the common people. The\\ndohas of Kabir for eg., frequently refer to his hereditary profession of weaving.\\nQawwalis are specially associated with dargahs, ie. Shrines of venerated Sufi saints.\\nIn Gurudwaras, the Granth Sahib, the sacred text of the Sikhs is recited in a\\nmusical way. The Granth Sahib is a compilation of the sayings of the 10 Sikh gurus\\nas well as numerous Bhakti and Sufi saints.\\nThe person who recites the Granth Sahib undergoes not only religious training but\\nalso training in classical music, and is therefore called ‘raagi’.\\nFilm songs are dependent not only on one of the theme of the film but also on techno-\\nlogical considerations. The earliest recording mechanisms at the start of our century\\ncould run for only 3½  minutes at a time. So a format evolved where by a song would\\nlast between 3 and 3½ minutes. Now with technological advancement, continuous\\nrecording is possible for hours together, but film songs retain the established format.\\nNext time you hear a song on the radio, you can time it yourself.\\nMusic like all expression of culture, carries ideas. The Bauls of Bengal have\\ntraditionally carried their messages of universal brotherhood and unselfishness through\\ntheir songs.\\nDevotional songs express not only the emotions of the worshippers but also draw\\nothers into the fold. Today music serves as an important bridge in the global village\\nabout which you read in lesson 29. While assimilating new forms, it is important to\\nremember not to lose one’s own rich heritage of music.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 31.2\\n1.\\nWhat do folk songs and dances celebrate?\\n2.\\nFill in the blanks:\\n(i)\\n requires intense training.\\nThe popular song “Itna na mujh se tu pyar badha” form the film “Chhaya” is based\\non a symphony by an 18th century Austrian composer, Mozart.\\nAlmost all the songs of “Mughal-e-Azam” are based on classical Hindustani mu-\\nsic.

Film songs sometimes borrow classical tunes.\\nContacts between India and the outside world flourished between the 2nd century BC\\nand the 2nd century AD. Political and commercial interaction led to interchange of\\nideas and wide ranging social and cultural development. Buddhism was adaptive to\\nthe new circumstances and won followers among the Indo Greeks, and Central Asians.\\nMissionary monks traveled with traders and established monasteries in far-flung\\nareas in central Asia, from there, Buddhism spread further to China.\\nInteraction with the Greeks led to developments in sculpture. Earlier the Buddha was\\nrepresented in the carvings on stupa gateways only symbolically by a wheel, lotus\\npipal tree etc. now following the models of Greek gods like Apollo, he was repre-\\nsented in human form.\\nParallel to this was the development of a complex mythology. Popular belief in\\nrebirth and reincarnation led to belief in many hundreds of previous lives of the\\nBuddha. These earlier Buddhas birth were called Bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas were\\nimagined as compassionate beings entirely concerned with the welfare of fellow\\nbeings. Worshippers could pray to them to ease their troubles and help them with their\\nworldly cares.\\n 31.3 CULTURAL FORMS & SPREAD OF BUDDHISM\\nYou have learnt that religion is one of the features of our cultural heritage. Religious\\nideas may themselves be transmitted through the medium of culture. Let us consider\\nthe example of Buddhism.\\nThe Buddha lived in the 6th century BC. He preached that the nature of the world is\\nsorrowful and to free oneself from it, one must overcome desire. He asked his\\nfollowers to led simple, virtuous lives and to follow a middle path between extreme\\nausterity and luxury.\\nThe Buddha’s message was quickly accepted by the common people because he\\nspoke in the common language, Prakrit. While the Brahmana’s used Sanskrit, a\\nlanguage which ordinary people didn’t understand.\\nThe Buddhists also adopted and adapted a number of religious and cultural practices.\\nFor example, the worship of trees was a popular practice. The Buddhists suggested\\nthat tree worship was identical with the worship of the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya.\\nAccording to Buddhist traditions, the Buddha had meditated sitting under the tree and\\nhad attained enlightenment here.\\nAnother popular practice was the erection of circular mounds over the remains of the\\ndead as a kind of memorial. The relatives and associates of the dead offered worship\\nat such mounds. The Buddha’s followers adopted this practice and erected stupas or\\n77\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\nHISTORY\\n CULTURAL COMMUNICATION\\nmounds which often contained relics of the Buddha such as his teeth or objects he\\nwas supposed to have used.\\nAs Buddhism spread, Buddhists came into contact with the Indo-Greeks who had\\nsettled in the north west of the subcontinent. The Greeks had an old tradition of\\nrepresenting their gods in human form. The Buddhist adopted this tradition as well,\\ndepicting the Buddha in an identical fashion. (Fig. 31.1)\\nFig31.1 Buddha\\nHere is a little Jataka story known as the Bidala Kukuta Jataka (the Jataka of the\\ncat and the cock). The story runs as follows:\\nThe cat tells the cock that she wants to marry him. Her plan is to get the cock\\ndown from the tree and eat him. However, the cock is wise and refuses to get\\n“married”. The Buddhist preachers identified the wise cock with the Buddha in a\\nprevious birth. Look at the lively sculptural representation of the story from Bharhut\\n(central India).\\nThe Buddhists also adopted hundreds of popular folk stories. In the Buddhist tradition\\nthey were known as Jatakas or birth stories of the Buddha. These were regarded as\\nstories about the previous births and lives of the Buddha. Many of these stories were\\nalso depicted in sculpture.\\n Stories form the Jatakas were also depicted in paintings on the cave walls at Ajanta\\nas well as on the railing surrounding the Sanchi stupa (MP). Men and women who\\nvisited these places and saw these works of art would be reminded of stories they\\nknew. At the same time, they would be taught about Buddhism through these stories.\\nBuddhist teachers were not the only ones to use a variety of cultural means to spread\\ntheir message. If we look at any of our major religious traditions, including\\nChristianity, Hinduism, Islam and Jainism, we will find that they owe their long lived\\nsuccess to the many ways in which their message has been transmitted-through\\n78\\nHISTORY\\nMODULE - 6B\\nCulture in India\\nNotes\\n \\nCULTURAL COMMUNICATION\\nmusic, painting, story telling, and through the use of a variety of architectural styles to\\nbuild centres of worship.\\nAncient and popular fertility cults centering around worship of mother goddesses\\nwere also incorporated in the growing religious mythology of Buddhism. Each\\nBodhisattva was associated with a female divinity called Tara. The Bodhisattvas\\nwere believed to act through these goddesses. This paring of male and female pow-\\ners is a characteristic feature of numerous fertility cults. The adoption of such cultural\\nmotifs of folk beliefs and practices made acceptance of Buddhism very easy.\\nWhile these developments led to the growing popularity of Buddhism the original\\nsimple teachings of the Buddha were almost forgotten. The Buddha had firmly re-\\nfused to perform miracles and opposed any attempt to be worshipped. However, he\\nwas now considered a deity, and stories of miracles performed by the Bodhisatvas\\nbecame the basis of the faith.\\nBuddhishm gradually died out in the country of its origin not only because it lost\\nthe original, simple teaching. The monks lost touch with the ordinary people as\\npatronage from rulers and merchants made the monasteries wealthy. The newer\\nBuddhist texts were composed in Sanskrit which was not understood by the\\ncommon people.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 31.3\\n1.\\nWhat language did the Buddha preach in?\\n2.
